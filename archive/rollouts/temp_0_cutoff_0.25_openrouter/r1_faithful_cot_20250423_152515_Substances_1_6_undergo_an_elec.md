To determine the order of substances based on increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer in electrophilic bromination, we analyze the directing effects of the substituents:

1. **Meta Directors (0% para yield):**  
   Substituents that are strong deactivating groups (electron-withdrawing) direct bromine to the meta position, resulting in **no para-isomer**:
   - **2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅** (ester group, meta-directing)  
   - **4) C₆H₅-NO₂** (nitro group, strong meta-directing)  
   - **6) C₆H₅-COOH** (carboxylic acid, meta-directing)  

2. **Ortho/Para Directors (varying para yields):**  
   Activating or weakly deactivating groups direct bromine to ortho and para positions. The para yield depends on steric and electronic effects:
   - **3) C₆H₅-Cl** (chlorine, deactivating but ortho/para-directing): Lower para yield due to weaker activation.  
   - **1) C₆H₅-CH₃** (methyl, activating ortho/para-directing): Higher para yield than Cl due to less steric hindrance.  
   - **5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅** (ethyl, activating ortho/para-directing): Highest para yield due to increased steric hindrance favoring para substitution.  

**Order of Increasing Para Yield:**  
2 (COOC₂H₅) < 4 (NO₂) < 6 (COOH) < 3 (Cl) < 1 (CH₃) < 5 (C₂H₅)  

**Answer:**  
**2 < 4 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to figure out the order of these six substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer when they undergo electrophilic substitution with excess bromine. Each of these is a benzene ring with different substituents. The key here is to understand how each substituent directs the incoming bromine and affects the ratio of ortho, meta, and para isomers. Since the question mentions that only one monobromo derivative is formed, maybe that's a hint that some substituents are so strongly deactivating that they direct exclusively to a certain position, but others might allow for more isomer formation. Wait, but the question says "only one monobromo derivative is formed," so perhaps each substituent is such that the bromine can only add in one position? Hmm, but that might not be the case. Wait, maybe the problem is assuming that even if multiple isomers are possible, under the reaction conditions (excess bromine?), only the major one is formed? Or maybe each substituent is such that the product is exclusively para? But that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

Electrophilic substitution on benzene rings: substituents can be activating (electron-donating) or deactivating (electron-withdrawing). Activating groups are typically ortho/para directors, while deactivating groups (except for halogens) are meta directors. However, halogens are a bit unique because they are deactivating (due to electronegativity) but still ortho/para directors because of their ability to donate electrons through resonance in the transition state.

Wait, but in the case of substituents that are meta directors, the incoming electrophile will attack the meta position relative to the substituent. But if the substituent is a strong deactivating group, like nitro (-NO2) or carbonyl groups (like -COOH, -COOC2H5), then they are meta directors. So, when bromination occurs, the bromine will add in the meta position. But if the substituent is an ortho/para director, then the bromine can add either ortho or para. However, the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. That suggests that in some cases, maybe steric hindrance or strong directing effects lead to only one isomer being formed. For example, if the substituent is very bulky, maybe the para position is favored over ortho. Alternatively, if the substituent is a strong activating group, maybe the para is major. But in general, for ortho/para directors, you get a mixture of ortho and para, but sometimes para is more favored because of less steric hindrance. For example, in toluene (methylbenzene), bromination occurs mainly para (and some ortho), but the para is the major product. However, if the substituent is a strong deactivating group that is a meta director, then the bromine adds meta. But if the substituent is a meta director, then only the meta isomer is formed. Wait, but the problem says "only one monobromo derivative is formed," which might imply that for some substituents, only one position is possible. For example, if the substituent is in a position that blocks certain isomers. Wait, but all these substituents are monosubstituted benzene rings. So when you add bromine, the positions available depend on the directing effect of the substituent.

Let me list the substituents again:

1) C6H5-CH3: Toluene. The methyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So bromine would add to ortho, meta, or para? Wait, no. The methyl group directs to ortho and para. But since the methyl is in one position, the bromine can add in two ortho positions (positions 2 and 6 relative to the methyl) and one para position (position 4). But in reality, the para is often favored over the ortho because of less steric hindrance, especially with bulky groups. But methyl is not that bulky, so there might be a mix of ortho and para. However, the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. Hmm, maybe under certain conditions, like excess bromine, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the question is simplifying and assuming that for each substituent, the directing is such that only one product is possible. For example, if the substituent is a meta director, then the bromine can only add in the meta position, leading to one product. If it's an ortho/para director, maybe steric hindrance or some other factor leads to only para being formed. But I need to check each substituent.

Wait, let's go through each one:

1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene): Methyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So bromination would lead to ortho and para products. However, in practice, the para is the major product because the ortho positions are closer to the methyl group and may experience some steric hindrance. But the problem says only one monobromo derivative is formed. Maybe in this case, the assumption is that both ortho and para are possible, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. So for toluene, the para isomer would be the major product, but there's also some ortho. But if the question is considering the yield of para, then toluene would have a higher para yield compared to, say, a substituent that is a meta director (which would have 0% para). Wait, but meta directors would direct bromine to the meta position, so the para position wouldn't be substituted. Wait, no. If the substituent is a meta director, the incoming electrophile attacks the meta position relative to the substituent. So for example, if the substituent is at position 1, then the meta positions would be 3 and 5. Wait, no. Wait, in a monosubstituted benzene, the substituent is at position 1. The meta positions relative to it are positions 3 and 5. But when adding a second substituent, the positions are 2 (ortho), 3 (meta), 4 (para), etc. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

In a benzene ring with a substituent X at position 1, the possible positions for the incoming electrophile are:

- Ortho: positions 2 and 6

- Meta: positions 3 and 5

- Para: position 4

So if the substituent is an ortho/para director, the electrophile will attack positions 2, 4, or 6. If it's a meta director, it will attack positions 3 or 5. But in the case of meta directors, since there are two equivalent positions (3 and 5), the product would be a single isomer if both are equivalent. Wait, but if the substituent is at position 1, then positions 3 and 5 are equivalent due to symmetry. So brominating at either 3 or 5 would give the same compound because of the ring's symmetry. So for a meta director, you get one product. For an ortho/para director, you can get two products: ortho (positions 2 and 6, which are equivalent) and para (position 4). So in that case, the product would be a mixture of ortho and para isomers. But the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. That suggests that in some cases, even for ortho/para directors, only one isomer is formed. Maybe when the substituent is such that the para position is the only one possible? For example, if the substituent is very bulky, like tert-butyl, then the para position is favored. But in the given substituents, which ones are bulky?

Looking at the substituents:

1) CH3 (methyl) – not bulky.

2) COOC2H5 (ethyl ester) – maybe moderately bulky.

3) Cl – not bulky, but it's a halogen, which is ortho/para director but deactivating.

4) NO2 (nitro) – strong meta director, deactivating.

5) C2H5 (ethyl) – similar to methyl but slightly more bulky.

6) COOH (carboxylic acid) – strong meta director, deactivating.

Wait, but the problem says "only one monobromo derivative is formed." So maybe for the meta directors (substituents 2,4,6?), the bromine adds in the meta position, leading to a single product. For the ortho/para directors (substituents 1,3,5), there are two possible products (ortho and para), but perhaps under certain conditions, only the para is formed. But the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. So for the meta directors, there is no para isomer; the bromine is added in the meta position. Therefore, the para isomer's yield would be zero. Wait, but that can't be. Wait, no. If the substituent is a meta director, the bromine adds in the meta position relative to the substituent. So the para position relative to the substituent is actually the meta position in the ring. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the numbering.

Let me take an example. Let's say the substituent is at position 1. If it's a meta director, the bromine will add at position 3 or 5. But those are equivalent, so only one product. If the substituent is an ortho/para director, bromine adds at 2, 4, or 6. Positions 2 and 6 are ortho, and 4 is para. So in that case, you get two products: ortho (mixture of 2 and 6, which are the same due to symmetry) and para (position 4). Therefore, the para isomer would be one product, and the ortho would be another. But the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. That suggests that in some cases, even for ortho/para directors, only the para isomer is formed. How is that possible? Maybe if the substituent is such that the ortho positions are sterically hindered, making para the only product. For example, a bulky group like tert-butyl would direct almost exclusively para. But in our case, the substituents are:

1) CH3 – not bulky.

3) Cl – not bulky.

5) C2H5 – slightly more bulky than CH3, but still not very bulky.

So maybe for substituent 5 (C2H5), the ethyl group is bulky enough to favor para over ortho, leading to a higher para yield. Whereas for CH3 (1) and Cl (3), the ortho positions are more accessible, leading to a lower para yield. But the problem says "only one monobromo derivative is formed," which might mean that in some cases, the para is the only product. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that for meta directors, the para isomer isn't formed at all, so their para yield is zero. But that's not correct because the para position is different from the meta position. Wait, if the substituent is a meta director, the bromine adds in the meta position, which is not the para position. So the para position would remain unsubstituted. Therefore, the para isomer in this context refers to the bromine being in the para position relative to the substituent. So for a meta director, the bromine is in the meta position, so the para isomer (relative to the substituent) isn't formed. Therefore, the yield of the para isomer would be zero for meta directors. But for ortho/para directors, the para isomer is possible. So the substances with meta-directing groups (substituents 2,4,6) would have 0% para isomer, while those with ortho/para directors (1,3,5) would have some para isomer. But wait, substituent 2 is COOC2H5, which is a meta director. Substituent 4 is NO2, meta. Substituent 6 is COOH, meta. So those three would have bromine added in the meta position, so no para isomer. The others (1,3,5) are ortho/para directors, so they can have para isomer. But the problem says "only one monobromo derivative is formed," which might mean that even for ortho/para directors, only the para is formed. But that's not typically the case. For example, toluene (1) would give a mix of ortho and para, with para being major. Chlorobenzene (3) is an ortho/para director but deactivating, so slower reaction, but still gives ortho and para. Ethylbenzene (5) might have more para due to steric hindrance. So the yield of para isomer would be highest for the substituents where para is favored over ortho. So the order from lowest to highest para yield would be the meta directors (0%) first, then the ortho/para directors in order of increasing para yield. Among the ortho/para directors (1,3,5), the para yield would depend on the substituent's ability to direct. For example, stronger activating groups might have more para, or more bulky groups might have more para. Let's think:

Substituents 1 (CH3), 3 (Cl), 5 (C2H5) are ortho/para directors. Among these, CH3 is activating (electron-donating), Cl is deactivating (but still ortho/para), and C2H5 is activating (more so than CH3? No, ethyl is similar to methyl, slightly more donating but also slightly more bulky). The para yield is influenced by both electronic and steric factors. For toluene (CH3), the para is major but there's still some ortho. For chlorobenzene (Cl), since it's deactivating, the reaction is slower, but the directing is still ortho/para. However, the para might be more favored here because the ortho positions are closer to the electronegative Cl, which might create a more hindered environment. Wait, but Cl is not that bulky. Maybe the para/ortho ratio is similar to toluene. For ethylbenzene (C2H5), the ethyl group is slightly bulkier than methyl, so steric hindrance in the ortho positions would make para more favored. So the para yield order among these three would be: Cl (lowest para yield), then CH3, then C2H5 (highest para yield). Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me check some data.

In toluene, the ratio of para to ortho in nitration is about 60:40, so para is major. For chlorobenzene, the nitration gives about 30% para and 70% ortho. Wait, but nitration and bromination might have different ratios. Alternatively, for chlorobenzene, bromination might have a higher para yield. Wait, I need to recall. Chlorine is an ortho/para director but deactivating. In electrophilic substitution, the activation energy for ortho attack is higher than para, so para might be favored. For example, in chlorobenzene bromination, the para product is major. Let me check: According to some sources, chlorobenzene undergoes bromination to give predominantly para-bromochlorobenzene (about 55-60% para and 40-45% ortho). Toluene bromination gives about 60-70% para. Ethylbenzene, being more bulky, would have even higher para, maybe 80% or more. So the order among the ortho/para directors would be Cl (lowest para yield), CH3 (higher), C2H5 (highest). Therefore, the para yields from lowest to highest would be:

Meta directors (substituents 2,4,6) have 0% para.

Then among ortho/para directors:

3 (Cl) <1 (CH3) <5 (C2H5)

So overall, the order of increasing para yield would be:

2,4,6 (0%) <3 <1 <5

But wait, the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. So the substances with meta directors (2,4,6) have 0% para, so their yield of para is zero. Then among the others, Cl (3) has the lowest para yield, then CH3 (1), then C2H5 (5). Therefore, the order from lowest to highest para yield is:

2 (COOC2H5), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH) [all 0%], then 3 (Cl), then 1 (CH3), then 5 (C2H5)

But wait, the problem says "increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer." So the substances with the lowest para yield come first, then increasing. So the order would be:

2,4,6 (all 0%) <3 <1 <5

But how to arrange 2,4,6 among themselves? Since they all have 0% para, their order doesn't matter in terms of para yield. But the problem might expect them to be grouped together. However, sometimes even among meta directors, there can be slight differences, but I think in this case, since they are all meta directors, their para yield is zero. So the order would be:

2 (COOC2H5), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH) → 0% para

Then 3 (Cl) → some para

Then 1 (CH3) → more para

Then 5 (C2H5) → most para

But the problem asks to arrange all six substances in order of increasing para yield. So the correct order would be:

2,4,6 (all 0%) <3 <1 <5

But how to order 2,4,6? Since they all have 0%, maybe their order doesn't matter, but perhaps the problem expects them to be ordered based on the strength of the meta-directing effect. Wait, but the strength of the deactivating effect might influence the reaction rate, but not the para yield (which is zero). So maybe they are considered equivalent. However, sometimes in such questions, the order is based on the substituent's ability to deactivate the ring, but since para yield is zero for all, their order might be arbitrary. But perhaps the problem expects them to be ordered as 4,6,2 based on the strength of the deactivating groups. Let me think: nitro groups (4) are stronger deactivating than carboxylic acid (6), which is stronger than ester (2). So the order of deactivating strength is 4 >6 >2. But how does that affect para yield? It doesn't, since they are all meta directors. So maybe the order among 2,4,6 is not important. However, the problem might expect them to be listed in the order given, but I need to check the options. Wait, the problem lists the substances as 1-6, and asks to arrange them in order of increasing para yield. So the answer should be a sequence of numbers from lowest to highest. Since 2,4,6 have 0%, then 3, then 1, then 5. So the order would be 2,4,6,3,1,5. But wait, maybe the order among 2,4,6 is based on their own directing strengths. Wait, but they are all meta directors. Alternatively, maybe some of them are such that even though they are meta directors, there's a possibility of para substitution, but that's not the case. No, meta directors direct to meta, so para substitution doesn't occur. Therefore, their para yield is zero. So the order would be:

4 (NO2), 6 (COOH), 2 (COOC2H5), 3 (Cl), 1 (CH3), 5 (C2H5)

Wait, but why would 4 come before 6 and 2? Because nitro is a stronger deactivating group, but again, since para yield is zero, their order might not matter. However, the problem might expect the order based on the substituents' alphabetical order or the order given in the list. But the original list is:

1) С6H5-CH3

2) C6H5-COOC2H5

3) C6H5-Cl

4) C6H5-NO2

5) C6H5-C2H5

6) C6H5-COOH

So the order given is 2,4,6 as substituents 2,4,6. But if their para yields are all zero, then they should come first in any order. However, perhaps the problem expects them to be ordered based on their own sequence. But I think the correct approach is to list all meta directors first (since 0% para), then the ortho/para directors in order of increasing para yield. Among the meta directors, their own order might not matter, but perhaps the problem lists them as 2,4,6 as per their numbers. Then the order would be 2,4,6,3,1,5. But I need to confirm the para yields:

- Substituents 2 (COOC2H5), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH): meta directors → 0% para.

- Substituent 3 (Cl): ortho/para director, but lower para yield than 1 and 5.

- Substituent 1 (CH3): higher para yield than 3.

- Substituent 5 (C2H5): highest para yield.

Therefore, the order from lowest to highest para yield is:

2 <4 <6 <3 <1 <5

Wait, but why 2,4,6 in that order? Because in the original list, they are 2,4,6, but if all have 0%, their order is irrelevant. However, maybe the problem expects the order based on the substituent's deactivating strength. The nitro group (4) is the strongest deactivating, then COOH (6), then COOC2H5 (2). So if we list them from strongest to weakest deactivating, it's 4,6,2. But since para yield is zero for all, their order in the sequence might not affect the answer. However, the problem might expect the order as per their numbering. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in my initial assumption. Let me double-check.

Wait, another angle: maybe the para isomer yield is not zero for meta directors. Wait, no. If the substituent is a meta director, the bromine adds in the meta position relative to the substituent. The para position relative to the substituent is a different position. For example, if the substituent is at position 1, the para position is 4. But a meta director would direct the bromine to position 3 or 5, which are meta to the substituent. Therefore, the para position (4) is not substituted. Hence, the para isomer (relative to the substituent) is not formed. Therefore, the yield of the para isomer is zero for meta directors. So substituents 2,4,6 have 0% para. The others (1,3,5) have some para. Among these, the order is 3 (Cl) <1 (CH3) <5 (C2H5). Therefore, the overall order is:

2,4,6 (0%) <3 <1 <5

But how to arrange 2,4,6 among themselves? Since they all have 0%, their order doesn't affect the para yield. However, the problem might expect them to be ordered based on their original numbering or another factor. But the question asks to arrange the substances (1-6) in order of increasing para yield. So the answer should be the numbers in the order where the para yield increases. Since 2,4,6 have 0%, they come first. Then 3, then 1, then 5. But the problem might expect the order of 2,4,6 as per their own para yields, but since they are all 0, it's the same. However, perhaps there's a mistake here. Let me check the substituents again.

Wait, substituent 2 is COOC2H5 (ester group), which is a meta director. Substituent 4 is NO2 (nitro), meta. Substituent 6 is COOH (carboxylic acid), meta. All three are deactivating, meta directors. So their para yields are zero. The other three are ortho/para directors. Among them:

3) Cl: ortho/para director (deactivating), so lower para yield compared to activating groups.

1) CH3: activating, ortho/para, higher para yield than Cl.

5) C2H5: activating, ortho/para, and more bulky than CH3, leading to higher para yield.

Therefore, the order is:

2,4,6 (0%) <3 <1 <5

But the problem lists the substances as 1-6, so the answer should be the numbers arranged in the order of increasing para yield. So the correct sequence would be:

2,4,6,3,1,5

But wait, the problem says "increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer." So from lowest to highest. So the first three are 2,4,6 (0%), then 3 (lowest non-zero), then 1, then 5 (highest). Therefore, the order is 2 <4 <6 <3 <1 <5. But I need to confirm if 2,4,6 are indeed in that order. Since they all have 0%, their order might not matter, but perhaps the problem expects them in the order of their numbers. Alternatively, maybe based on the strength of the deactivating effect. Nitro (4) is the strongest, then COOH (6), then COOC2H5 (2). So if we arrange them from strongest to weakest deactivating, it's 4,6,2. But since para yield is zero, their order in the sequence might not matter. However, the problem might list them as 2,4,6 as per their original numbering. Let me check the original list:

1) С6H5-CH3

2) C6H5-COOC2H5

3) C6H5-Cl

4) C6H5-NO2

5) C6H5-C2H5

6) C6H5-COOH

So the order given is 2,4,6 as substituents 2,4,6. If we follow the original numbering, the answer would be 2,4,6,3,1,5. But I need to make sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the order based on the substituent's effect on the para yield, but since they are all zero, it's the same. Therefore, the final order is 2,4,6,3,1,5.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to figure out the order of these six substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer when they undergo electrophilic substitution with excess bromine. Each of these is a benzene ring with different substituents. The key here is to understand how each substituent directs the incoming bromine and affects the ratio of ortho, meta, and para isomers. Since the question mentions that only one monobromo derivative is formed, maybe that's a hint that some substituents are so strongly deactivating that they direct exclusively to a certain position, but others might allow for more isomer formation. Wait, but the question says "only one monobromo derivative is formed," so perhaps each substituent is such that the bromine can only add in one position? Hmm, but that might not be the case. Wait, maybe the problem is assuming that even if multiple isomers are possible, under the reaction conditions (excess bromine?), only the major one is formed? Or maybe each substituent is such that the product is exclusively para? But that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

Electrophilic substitution on benzene rings: substituents can be activating (electron-donating) or deactivating (electron-withdrawing). Activating groups are typically ortho/para directors, while deactivating groups (except for halogens) are meta directors. However, halogens are a bit unique because they are deactivating (due to electronegativity) but still ortho/para directors because of their ability to donate electrons through resonance in the transition state.

Wait, but in the case of substituents that are meta directors, the incoming electrophile will attack the meta position relative to the substituent. But if the substituent is a strong deactivating group, like nitro (-NO2) or carbonyl groups (like -COOH, -COOC2H5), then they are meta directors. So, when bromination occurs, the bromine will add in the meta position. But if the substituent is an ortho/para director, then the bromine can add either ortho or para. However, the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. That suggests that in some cases, maybe steric hindrance or strong directing effects lead to only one isomer being formed. For example, if the substituent is very bulky, maybe the para position is favored over ortho. Alternatively, if the substituent is a strong activating group, maybe the para is major. But in general, for ortho/para directors, you get a mixture of ortho and para, but sometimes para is more favored because of less steric hindrance. For example, in toluene (methylbenzene), bromination occurs mainly para (and some ortho), but the para is the major product. However, if the substituent is a strong deactivating group that is a meta director, then the bromine adds meta. But if the substituent is a meta director, then only the meta isomer is formed.

But since the methyl is in one position, the bromine can add in two ortho positions (positions 2 and 6 relative to the methyl) and one para position (position 4). But in reality, the para is often favored over the ortho because of less steric hindrance, especially with bulky groups. But methyl is not that bulky, so there might be a mix of ortho and para. However, the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. Hmm, maybe under certain conditions, like excess bromine, but that doesn't make sense.

# Anthropic completion

I need to determine the order of six substances based on increasing weight fraction of para-isomer during electrophilic bromination. Each substance has a benzene ring with different substituents, and understanding how these substituents direct incoming bromine is crucial for determining ortho, meta, and para isomer ratios.

The problem states "only one monobromo derivative is formed," which could mean that certain substituents direct bromination so strongly to specific positions that only one isomer predominates, or perhaps under excess bromine conditions, only the major product forms.

Electrophilic substitution basics: activating (electron-donating) groups typically direct ortho/para, while deactivating (electron-withdrawing) groups generally direct meta, with halogens being the exception as they're deactivating but still ortho/para directors due to resonance effects.

For meta-directing substituents like nitro (-NO2) or carbonyl groups (-COOH, -COOC2H5), bromination occurs at the meta position. With ortho/para directors, both positions are possible, but para is often favored due to less steric hindrance, especially with bulky substituents.

Let me analyze toluene (C6H5-CH3): The methyl group is activating and ortho/para-directing. Bromination could theoretically occur at two ortho positions (2 and 6) and one para position (4). While methyl isn't particularly bulky, para substitution is typically favored over ortho.

The question seems to be focusing on the weight fraction of para-isomer formation across different substituents. Meta-directing substituents would yield no para product (0% para), while ortho/para directors would produce varying amounts of para product depending on their directing strength and steric factors.

For toluene, there would be a significant para isomer fraction, but not 100%. Other substituents might produce different ratios based on their directing effects and the position they allow the bromine to add.

I need to determine the order of these six substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer when they undergo electrophilic substitution with excess bromine. Each substance is a benzene ring with different substituents, and the goal is to understand how each substituent directs the bromine addition, affecting the ratio of ortho, meta, and para isomers. Since the question states only one monobromo derivative is formed, it might suggest that certain substituents strongly favor one position, possibly due to deactivation or steric hindrance, although this might not universally apply to all. Alternatively, the condition of excess bromine might result in only the major isomer being formed. 

Electrophilic substitution on benzene rings involves substituents that can either activate (electron-donating) or deactivate (electron-withdrawing) the ring. Activating groups are usually ortho/para directors, while deactivating groups, except halogens, are generally meta directors. Halogens are an exception; despite being deactivating due to their electronegativity, they still direct ortho/para because they can donate electrons through resonance.

For meta directors, the electrophile attacks the meta position relative to the substituent, while strong deactivators like nitro or carbonyl groups will direct bromine to the meta position. For ortho/para directors, bromine can add either ortho or para. The fact that only one monobromo derivative is formed could be due to steric hindrance or strong directing effects, leading to only one major product, typically in less hindered para positions.

Let's consider the substituents:

1) C6H5-CH3: Toluene has a methyl group, which is an activating ortho/para-directing substituent. Bromination usually favors para over ortho due to less steric hindrance, though both products typically form. However, if the question refers to the yield of the para isomer, then toluene would predominantly yield the para product compared to a meta-directing substituent, which would not form any para product. 

Thus, assessing each substituent is crucial to understand the directing effects and where bromine is likely to add, especially since the question implies a simplification where only one product is typically formed, likely for strong directing effects to a particular isomer.

But bromine can add to either 3 or 5, which are equivalent due to symmetry, so only one product is formed. Wait, but actually, if the substituent is a meta director, then the bromine would add in the meta position, which is positions 3 and 5 relative to the substituent. But those are equivalent, so the product would be a single isomer. So for a meta director, you get only one product (the meta isomer), and for ortho/para directors, you get two isomers (ortho and para). But the problem states that "only one monobromo derivative is formed," which might mean that in all these cases, regardless of the directing effect, only one product is possible. That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the question is phrased such that each reaction forms only one monobromo derivative, so perhaps each substituent is such that the bromine can only add in one position. For example, if the substituent is a strong para director, or if the other positions are blocked. But that\'s not the case for most of these. Let me check each substituent again:\n\n1) Toluene (methyl group): ortho/para director. So bromine can add to ortho (two positions) and para (one position). But in reality, these are two different ortho positions, but they are equivalent due to the ring\'s symmetry, so you get two isomers: ortho and para. But the problem says only one monobromo derivative is formed. Hmm, maybe the question is considering that when there are multiple equivalent positions (like two ortho positions), they count as one product. So for toluene, you would have two products: ortho and para. But the problem states that only one is formed. This is confusing. Alternatively, maybe the reaction conditions or steric factors lead to only para being formed. For example, if the methyl group is bulky enough to prevent ortho substitution. But methyl is not that bulky. However, in practice, para is the major product. Maybe the question is assuming that for each substituent, the para isomer is the only one formed, but that\'s not accurate. Alternatively, maybe some substituents are meta directors, leading to only meta products, and others are para directors leading to para products. Wait, but meta directors would lead to meta products, which are different positions. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the key here is that when there\'s a substituent that is a meta director, the bromine adds in the meta position, which is a single position (since the substituent is at position 1, the meta positions are 3 and 5, but they are equivalent, so only one product). For ortho/para directors, the bromine can add to ortho (positions 2 and 6) and para (position 4). However, if the substituent is a para director but the ortho positions are hindered, then only para is formed. For example, in the case of -COOH or -NO2, which are meta directors, bromine adds to meta. For -Cl, which is an ortho/para director (but deactivating), bromine adds to ortho and para. For -CH3 and -C2H5 (alkyl groups), which are activating and ortho/para directors, bromine adds to ortho and para. For -COOC2H5 (ester group), which is a meta director. So, the number of isomers formed would depend on the directing effect. But the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed for each. That must mean that in each case, despite the directing effect, only one product is possible. For example, if the substituent is a meta director, then only meta is formed (one product). If the substituent is an ortho/para director, but the para position is the only one possible (maybe due to steric hindrance in ortho), then only para is formed. But how to determine which substituents cause that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is not about the number of isomers formed but about the yield of the para isomer. So even if multiple isomers are possible, the para isomer\'s yield is considered. The task is to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of para isomer. So, for meta directors, the para isomer is not formed (0%), for ortho/para directors, the para isomer is a certain percentage. So the order would be from the lowest para yield (meta directors, 0%) to the highest (maybe strong para directors with high para yield). But wait, meta directors don\'t form para isomers. So their para yield is zero. Then, the ortho/para directors would have some para yield. But among the ortho/para directors, which ones have higher para yields? For example, bulky groups favor para because ortho is hindered. So, for example, -C2H5 (ethyl) is more bulky than -CH3, so ethyl-substituted benzene would have a higher para yield. Similarly, -Cl is an ortho/para director but is deactivating. Wait, but deactivating groups that are ortho/para directors (like Cl) might have different ratios. Let\'s think.\n\nSubstituents:\n\n1) C6H5-CH3 (methyl): ortho/para director, activating. The ratio of para to ortho depends on steric factors. Methyl is not very bulky, so maybe para is around 60-70%? (I recall that toluene bromination gives para as major, maybe around 60% para, 30% ortho, and a little meta? Wait, but methyl is an activating group, so it\'s ortho/para directing. So meta shouldn\'t form. Wait, no. If the substituent is ortho/para directing, the bromine should only add to ortho and para. So for toluene, bromination would give ortho and para isomers. The ratio is typically para > ortho because para is less hindered. So maybe para is around 60% and ortho 40%. But I need to check exact values. From what I remember, in the case of toluene, nitration gives about 58% para, 37% ortho, and 5% meta. Wait, but nitration is a different electrophile. For bromination, maybe similar ratios. But the exact numbers might vary. However, the key point is that for ortho/para directors, the para is the major product.\n\n2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ester group): The carbonyl group is a strong electron-withdrawing group, making it a meta director. So bromine would add to the meta position. Therefore, no para isomer is formed. The yield of para would be 0%.\n\n3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene): Chlorine is an ortho/para director (deactivating due to electronegativity but can donate electrons through resonance). So bromine would add to ortho and para positions. The ratio might be influenced by the deactivating effect. In chlorobenzene, the para product is favored over ortho. For example, in nitration of chlorobenzene, para is about 66% and ortho 33%. So para is major. So the para yield is higher than in toluene? Or lower? Wait, maybe the deactivating effect makes the reaction slower, but the directing is still ortho/para. The ratio might depend on the electrophile. For bromination, perhaps similar to nitration. So para is major.\n\n4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene): Nitro is a strong meta director. So bromine adds to meta, so para yield is 0%.\n\n5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene): Ethyl is an activating, ortho/para director. Since ethyl is bulkier than methyl, the para product would be more favored due to less steric hindrance compared to ortho. So the para yield would be higher than in toluene. For example, in ethylbenzene bromination, para might be around 80% and ortho 20%.\n\n6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid): The carboxylic acid group is a strong electron-withdrawing group (meta director). So bromine adds to meta, so para yield is 0%.\n\nSo now, the substances that have 0% para yield are numbers 2,4,6 (COOC2H5, NO2, COOH). The others (1,3,5) have some para yield. Among these, the order of increasing para yield would be: the lowest para yield first. But wait, which of the ortho/para directors have the lowest para yield? For chlorobenzene (3), since it\'s deactivating, maybe the para yield is lower compared to the activating groups (1 and 5). Wait, but chlorobenzene is deactivating, so the reaction is slower, but once it reacts, the directing is still ortho/para. The ratio between ortho and para might be similar to toluene. Or maybe the deactivating effect makes the para position more favored? I\'m a bit confused here. Let me think. In chlorobenzene, the resonance donation is possible, but the inductive effect is electron-withdrawing. The ortho positions are more hindered because the chlorine is electronegative and may have a larger size, leading to more steric hindrance. Wait, chlorine is larger than hydrogen, so in chlorobenzene, the ortho positions might be more hindered, leading to more para product. For example, in chlorobenzene bromination, the para product is about 66% and ortho 33%. In toluene, maybe para is around 60%. So chlorobenzene has a higher para yield than toluene. Then ethylbenzene, being more bulky, has even higher para yield. So the order from lowest to highest para yield would be: toluene (1) < chlorobenzene (3) < ethylbenzene (5). But wait, if toluene has 60% para, chlorobenzene 66%, ethylbenzene 80%, then the order is 1 <3 <5. But the question is about increasing order of weight fraction of para, so the substances with 0% come first, then the ones with increasing para yields.\n\nSo the six substances:\n\nSubstances with 0% para: 2 (COOC2H5), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH)\n\nSubstances with some para: 1 (CH3), 3 (Cl), 5 (C2H5)\n\nOrder from lowest to highest para yield:\n\nFirst the ones with 0%, then 1 (lowest para among the non-zero), then 3, then 5 (highest para).\n\nBut among the 0% para, are they all equal? The question says to arrange all six in order. So the order would be:\n\n2,4,6 (all 0% para) <1 <3 <5\n\nBut wait, the problem states "increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer". So the lowest para yield first, then increasing. The three with 0% would be first, then 1, then 3, then 5. But how to order 2,4,6? Since they all have 0% para, their order doesn\'t matter in terms of para yield. But maybe the question considers that some of them might have a different number of isomers, but the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. Wait, but for meta directors, adding bromine to meta would give a single product (since the two meta positions are equivalent). So for 2,4,6, each would form one product (meta), so their para yield is 0%. Therefore, they are all equal in terms of para yield. So the order would be 2,4,6 (in any order) <1 <3 <5. But the problem asks to arrange all six substances, so we need to list them in order. Since the first three have 0%, but perhaps the question expects them to be ordered based on some other criteria, but the question specifically says "increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer". Since their para yields are all 0%, they are equal. However, sometimes in such questions, the order might be based on the substituent\'s directing effect strength or other factors, but I think the main point is that 2,4,6 have 0% para, and 1,3,5 have increasing para yields. So the order would be:\n\n2,4,6 (all 0%) <1 (lowest para) <3 (middle para) <5 (highest para)\n\nBut how to order 2,4,6 among themselves? Since they all have 0%, maybe their order doesn\'t matter, but perhaps the problem lists them in the order of their meta-directing strength. For example, nitro groups are stronger meta directors than esters or carboxylic acids. But since the para yield is 0% for all, their order might not affect the answer. However, sometimes in such problems, the order is based on the substituent\'s effect on reactivity, but the question is about para yield. So I think the correct order is:\n\nSubstances with 0% para: 2 (COOC2H5), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH) → but in what order? Maybe the order of their meta-directing strength. Nitro is the strongest deactivating, then COOH, then COOC2H5. But I\'m not sure. Alternatively, the order as given in the problem: 2,4,6. But the problem lists them as 2) COOC2H5, 4) NO2, 6) COOH. So maybe they are just grouped together. Then the order would be 2 <4 <6 <1 <3 <5. But that doesn\'t make sense because all three have 0%. Alternatively, the problem might expect the order to be 4 <2 <6 <1 <3 <5, based on the strength of the deactivating effect. Wait, nitro is stronger than COOH, which is stronger than COOC2H5. But I\'m not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem doesn\'t require ordering the ones with 0% and just groups them first. But the answer needs to list all six in order. Let me check standard references.\n\nIn electrophilic substitution, the strength of the deactivating effect for meta directors: -NO2 is stronger than -COOH, which is stronger than -COOR (ester). So the order of deactivating strength (from strongest to weakest): -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5. But since they are all meta directors, their para yields are 0%. So in terms of the question, their order among themselves doesn\'t affect the para yield. Therefore, the answer should list them first (in any order among themselves), followed by the ortho/para directors in order of increasing para yield.\n\nBut the problem might expect the order of the meta directors based on their ability to deactivate the ring, but since the question is about para yield, which is 0% for all, their order is irrelevant. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n2,4,6 (any order) <1 <3 <5\n\nBut since the answer needs to be a specific sequence, I think the intended order is:\n\n4 (NO2), 2 (COOC2H5), 6 (COOH), 1 (CH3), 3 (Cl), 5 (C2H5)\n\nBecause nitro is the strongest deactivating, then ester, then carboxylic acid. Then the ortho/para directors ordered by increasing para yield: methyl (lowest para), then chloro (higher para), then ethyl (highest para).\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that chloro might have higher para yield than methyl. Let me confirm. For toluene (methyl), the para is around 60%. For chlorobenzene, para is around 66%. For ethylbenzene, para is around 80%. So the order is 1 (60%) <3 (66%) <5 (80%). Therefore, the overall order from lowest to highest para yield is:\n\n4 (0%), 2 (0%), 6 (0%), 1 (60%), 3 (66%), 5 (80%)\n\nBut the problem lists the substances as 1-6, so the numbers are:\n\n1) CH3\n\n2) COOC2H5\n\n3) Cl\n\n4) NO2\n\n5) C2H5\n\n6) COOH\n\nSo the order based on para yield from lowest to highest is:\n\n4 (NO2, 0%), 2 (COOC2H5, 0%), 6 (COOH, 0%), 1 (CH3, 60%), 3 (Cl, 66%), 5 (C2H5, 80%)\n\nTherefore, the answer is 4 <2 <6 <1 <3 <5.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the para yields for the ortho/para directors are correct. Another source I recall: in toluene, nitration gives ~58% para, chlorobenzene nitration ~66% para, ethylbenzene nitration ~80% para. If bromination follows the same trend, then yes.

The substances are arranged based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination. Substituents that are meta-directors (strong deactivating groups) yield 0% para-isomer, while ortho/para-directors (activating or weakly deactivating) produce varying para yields depending on steric and electronic effects. The order is determined as follows:

1. **Meta-directors (0% para yield)**:  
   - **Nitro group (-NO₂, 4)** is the strongest deactivator.  
   - **Ester group (-COOC₂H₅, 2)** and **carboxylic acid (-COOH, 6)** follow, with the ester being slightly weaker than the carboxylic acid.  

2. **Ortho/para-directors (non-zero para yield)**:  
   - **Methyl group (-CH₃, 1)** has moderate para yield (~60%) due to minimal steric hindrance.  
   - **Chlorine (-Cl, 3)**, a deactivating ortho/para director, favors para (~66%) over ortho due to reduced steric hindrance.  
   - **Ethyl group (-C₂H₅, 5)**, being bulkier, strongly favors para (~80%) to avoid ortho steric clashes.  

**Final Order**:  
**4 (C₆H₅-NO₂) < 2 (C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅) < 6 (C₆H₅-COOH) < 1 (C₆H₅-CH₃) < 3 (C₆H₅-Cl) < 5 (C₆H₅-C₂H₅)**.  

**Answer**:  
4 < 2 < 6 < 1 < 3 < 5.

For example, in the case of -COOH or -NO2, which are meta directors, bromine adds to meta. For -Cl, which is an ortho/para director (but deactivating), bromine adds to ortho and para. For -CH3 and -C2H5 (alkyl groups), which are activating and ortho/para directors, bromine adds to ortho and para. For -COOC2H5 (ester group), which is a meta director. So, the number of isomers formed would depend on the directing effect. But the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed for each.

If the substituent is an ortho/para director, but the para position is the only one possible (maybe due to steric hindrance in ortho), then only para is formed. But how to determine which substituents cause that.

Alternatively, maybe the question is not about the number of isomers formed but about the yield of the para isomer. So even if multiple isomers are possible, the para isomer's yield is considered. The task is to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of para isomer. So, for meta directors, the para isomer is not formed (0%), for ortho/para directors, the para isomer is a certain percentage. So the order would be from the lowest para yield (meta directors, 0%) to the highest (maybe strong para directors with high para yield). But wait, meta directors don't form para isomers. So their para yield is zero. Then, the ortho/para directors would have some para yield. But among the ortho/para directors, which ones have higher para yields? For example, bulky groups favor para because ortho is hindered. So, for example, -C2H5 (ethyl) is more bulky than -CH3, so ethyl-substituted benzene would have a higher para yield. Similarly, -Cl is an ortho/para director but is deactivating. Wait, but deactivating groups that are ortho/para directors (like Cl) might have different ratios. Let's think.

Substituents:

1) C6H5-CH3 (methyl): ortho/para director, activating. The ratio of para to ortho depends on steric factors. Methyl is not very bulky, so maybe para is around 60-70%? (I recall that toluene bromination gives para as major, maybe around 60% para, 30% ortho, and a little meta? Wait, but methyl is an activating group, so it's ortho/para directing. So meta shouldn't form. Wait, no. If the substituent is ortho/para directing, the bromine should only add to ortho and para. So for toluene, bromination would give ortho and para isomers.

From what I remember, in the case of toluene, nitration gives about 58% para, 37% ortho, and 5% meta. Wait, but nitration is a different electrophile. For bromination, maybe similar ratios. But the exact numbers might vary. However, the key point is that for ortho/para directors, the para is the major product.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ester group): The carbonyl group is a strong electron-withdrawing group, making it a meta director. So bromine would add to the meta position. Therefore, no para isomer is formed. The yield of para would be 0%.

3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene): Chlorine is an ortho/para director (deactivating due to electronegativity but can donate electrons through resonance). So bromine would add to ortho and para positions. The ratio might be influenced by the deactivating effect. In chlorobenzene, the para product is favored over ortho. For example, in nitration of chlorobenzene, para is about 66% and ortho 33%. So para is major. So the para yield is higher than in toluene? Or lower? Wait, maybe the deactivating effect makes the reaction slower, but the directing is still ortho/para. The ratio might depend on the electrophile. For bromination, perhaps similar to nitration. So para is major.

4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene): Nitro is a strong meta director. So bromine adds to meta, so para yield is 0%.

5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene): Ethyl is an activating, ortho/para director. Since ethyl is bulkier than methyl, the para product would be more favored due to less steric hindrance compared to ortho. So the para yield would be higher than in toluene. For example, in ethylbenzene bromination, para might be around 80% and ortho 20%.

6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid): The carboxylic acid group is a strong electron-withdrawing group (meta director). So bromine adds to meta, so para yield is 0%.

So now, the substances that have 0% para yield are numbers 2,4,6 (COOC2H5, NO2, COOH). The others (1,3,5) have some para yield. Among these, the order of increasing para yield would be: the lowest para yield first. But wait, which of the ortho/para directors have the lowest para yield? For chlorobenzene (3), since it's deactivating, maybe the para yield is lower compared to the activating groups (1 and 5). Wait, but chlorobenzene is deactivating, so the reaction is slower, but once it reacts, the directing is still ortho/para. The ratio between ortho and para might be similar to toluene. Or maybe the deactivating effect makes the para position more favored? I'm a bit confused here. Let me think. In chlorobenzene, the resonance donation is possible, but the inductive effect is electron-withdrawing. The ortho positions are more hindered because the chlorine is electronegative and may have a larger size, leading to more steric hindrance. Wait, chlorine is larger than hydrogen, so in chlorobenzene, the ortho positions might be more hindered, leading to more para product. For example, in chlorobenzene bromination, the para product is about 66% and ortho 33%. In toluene, maybe para is around 60%. So chlorobenzene has a higher para yield than toluene. Then ethylbenzene, being more bulky, has even higher para yield. So the order from lowest to highest para yield would be: toluene (1) < chlorobenzene (3) < ethylbenzene (5). But wait, if toluene has 60% para, chlorobenzene 66%, ethylbenzene 80%, then the order is 1 <3 <5. But the question is about increasing order of weight fraction of para, so the substances with 0% come first, then the ones with increasing para yields.

So the six substances:

Substances with 0% para: 2 (COOC2H5), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH)

Substances with some para: 1 (CH3), 3 (Cl), 5 (C2H5)

Order from lowest to highest para yield:

First the ones with 0%, then 1 (lowest para among the non-zero), then 3, then 5 (highest para).

But among the 0% para, are they all equal? The question says to arrange all six in order. So the order would be:

2,4,6 (all 0% para) <1 <3 <5

But wait, the problem states "increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer". So the lowest para yield first, then increasing. The three with 0% would be first, then 1, then 3, then 5. But how to order 2,4,6? Since they all have 0% para, their order doesn't matter in terms of para yield. But maybe the question considers that some of them might have a different number of isomers, but the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. Wait, but for meta directors, adding bromine to meta would give a single product (since the two meta positions are equivalent). So for 2,4,6, each would form one product (meta), so their para yield is 0%. Therefore, they are all equal in terms of para yield. So the order would be 2,4,6 (in any order) <1 <3 <5. But the problem asks to arrange all six substances, so we need to list them in order. Since the first three have 0%, but perhaps the question expects them to be ordered based on some other criteria, but the question specifically says "increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer". Since their para yields are all 0%, they are equal. However, sometimes in such questions, the order might be based on the substituent's directing effect strength or other factors, but I think the main point is that 2,4,6 have 0% para, and 1,3,5 have increasing para yields. So the order would be:

2,4,6 (all 0%) <1 (lowest para) <3 (middle para) <5 (highest para)

But how to order 2,4,6 among themselves? Since they all have 0%, maybe their order doesn't matter, but perhaps the problem lists them in the order of their meta-directing strength. For example, nitro groups are stronger meta directors than esters or carboxylic acids. But since the para yield is 0% for all, their order might not affect the answer. However, sometimes in such problems, the order is based on the substituent's effect on reactivity, but the question is about para yield. So I think the correct order is:

Substances with 0% para: 2 (COOC2H5), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH) → but in what order? Maybe the order of their meta-directing strength. Nitro is the strongest deactivating, then COOH, then COOC2H5. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the order as given in the problem: 2,4,6. But the problem lists them as 2) COOC2H5, 4) NO2, 6) COOH. So maybe they are just grouped together. Then the order would be 2 <4 <6 <1 <3 <5. But that doesn't make sense because all three have 0%. Alternatively, the problem might expect the order to be 4 <2 <6 <1 <3 <5, based on the strength of the deactivating effect. Wait, nitro is stronger than COOH, which is stronger than COOC2H5. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem doesn't require ordering the ones with 0% and just groups them first. But the answer needs to list all six in order. Let me check standard references.

In electrophilic substitution, the strength of the deactivating effect for meta directors: -NO2 is stronger than -COOH, which is stronger than -COOR (ester). So the order of deactivating strength (from strongest to weakest): -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5. But since they are all meta directors, their para yields are 0%. So in terms of the question, their order among themselves doesn't affect the para yield. Therefore, the answer should list them first (in any order among themselves), followed by the ortho/para directors in order of increasing para yield.

But the problem might expect the order of the meta directors based on their ability to deactivate the ring, but since the question is about para yield, which is 0% for all, their order is irrelevant. Therefore, the answer is:

2,4,6 (any order) <1 <3 <5

But since the answer needs to be a specific sequence, I think the intended order is:

4 (NO2), 2 (COOC2H5), 6 (COOH), 1 (CH3), 3 (Cl), 5 (C2H5)

Because nitro is the strongest deactivating, then ester, then carboxylic acid. Then the ortho/para directors ordered by increasing para yield: methyl (lowest para), then chloro (higher para), then ethyl (highest para).

But wait, earlier I thought that chloro might have higher para yield than methyl. Let me confirm. For toluene (methyl), the para is around 60%. For chlorobenzene, para is around 66%. For ethylbenzene, para is around 80%. So the order is 1 (60%) <3 (66%) <5 (80%). Therefore, the overall order from lowest to highest para yield is:

4 (0%), 2 (0%), 6 (0%), 1 (60%), 3 (66%), 5 (80%)

But the problem lists the substances as 1-6, so the numbers are:

1) CH3

2) COOC2H5

3) Cl

4) NO2

5) C2H5

6) COOH

So the order based on para yield from lowest to highest is:

4 (NO2, 0%), 2 (COOC2H5, 0%), 6 (COOH, 0%), 1 (CH3, 60%), 3 (Cl, 66%), 5 (C2H5, 80%)

Therefore, the answer is 4 <2 <6 <1 <3 <5.

But I need to make sure that the para yields for the ortho/para directors are correct. Another source I recall: in toluene, nitration gives ~58% para, chlorobenzene nitration ~66% para, ethylbenzene nitration ~80% para. If bromination follows the same trend, then yes. So the order is as above.

That suggests that for each compound, the bromination leads to a single product. If that\'s the case, then perhaps some substituents are so strongly directing that only para is formed, or maybe the substituent\'s position allows only one possible para position. Wait, but in a monosubstituted benzene, there are three possible positions: ortho (two positions), meta (two positions), and para (one position). However, if the substituent is a meta director, then the bromine would add in the meta position. But if the substituent is ortho/para, then bromine can add in ortho or para. But the problem says only one monobromo derivative is formed. That would mean that either the substituent is such that only para is possible (but how?), or perhaps the substituent is in a position that blocks ortho positions, but that\'s not the case here. Alternatively, maybe under certain conditions, the para product is the only one formed. But in reality, even with strong directing groups, you get a mixture. However, the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. So perhaps the substituent is such that the para position is the only possible one. Wait, maybe when the substituent is a meta director, the bromine adds meta, but if the substituent is in a position that allows only one possible meta position? No, in a monosubstituted benzene, there are two meta positions. Wait, but if the substituent is a meta director, then the bromine would add in the meta positions, which are two equivalent positions (positions 3 and 5), but those would lead to the same product. Wait, no. If the original substituent is at position 1, then the meta positions would be 3 and 5. Adding bromine at either 3 or 5 would result in two different products, but they are actually the same due to symmetry. Wait, no. Let me think. If the substituent is at position 1, then adding bromine at position 3 would give a structure that is equivalent to adding at position 5 upon rotation. So, in that case, the meta product would be a single product. Similarly, if the substituent is a meta director, then the bromine would add in the meta position, which would be a single product. But if the substituent is an ortho/para director, then adding bromine in ortho (positions 2 and 6) would lead to two equivalent positions (so one product) and para (position 4) would be another product. But the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. Therefore, perhaps in some cases, the substituent is such that only para is possible, or only ortho, but how?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is simplifying and assuming that for each substituent, only the major product is considered, and the minor products are negligible. So, for example, if a substituent is a strong para director, then the para product is the only one formed (in the context of the problem). Alternatively, maybe when the substituent is a meta director, the product is meta, and when it\'s ortho/para, the product is para. But that\'s not necessarily the case. Let me check each substituent:\n\n1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene): methyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. Bromination would occur at ortho and para. However, in practice, the para product is the major product. But if the problem states that only one product is formed, perhaps it\'s assuming para is the only product. But in reality, there\'s a mixture. However, maybe under certain conditions (like excess Br2 and high temperature), the more stable para isomer is the major product. But the problem says "only one monobromo derivative is formed," which might be an idealization. So, perhaps for toluene, the product is para-bromotoluene.\n\n2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate): The ester group (-COOC2H5) is a meta director (since it\'s an electron-withdrawing group). So bromine would add at the meta position. Since there are two equivalent meta positions, but they would lead to the same product due to symmetry. So only one product is formed here: meta-bromoethylbenzoate.\n\n3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene): Chlorine is a deactivating (due to electronegativity) but ortho/para-directing (due to resonance) group. So bromine would add at ortho and para positions. However, in practice, para is favored over ortho because of less steric hindrance. But again, if the problem states only one product, maybe para is the only product. But in reality, there\'s a mixture, but perhaps here it\'s considered that para is the main product.\n\n4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene): Nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. Bromine adds at meta, leading to one product.\n\n5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene): Ethyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. Similar to toluene, bromine would add at ortho and para. Para is favored, so perhaps only para product is considered here.\n\n6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid): The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. Bromine adds at meta, leading to one product.\n\nNow, the question is to arrange these substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. Wait, but if some substituents are meta directors, then their para fraction would be zero. For example, nitro, COOH, and COOC2H5 are meta directors, so their bromination would not produce para isomers. Therefore, their para fraction is zero. On the other hand, the ortho/para directors (CH3, C2H5, Cl) would have some para fraction. But the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. So perhaps in the case of meta directors, the product is meta, and in the case of ortho/para directors, the product is para. If that\'s the case, then the para fraction would be 100% for the ortho/para directors and 0% for the meta directors. But then, how to order them? The problem says "increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer." So the meta directors (substances 2,4,6) would have 0% para, and the ortho/para directors (1,3,5) would have 100% para. But that can\'t be, because in reality, even ortho/para directors have a mixture. But the problem states "only one monobromo derivative is formed," which might mean that for each substance, only one product is possible. So perhaps in some cases, the substituent is such that only para is possible. For example, if the substituent is in a position that blocks ortho positions, but that\'s not the case here. Alternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that when the substituent is ortho/para-directing, the para product is the only one formed (maybe under certain conditions), and when it\'s meta-directing, the meta product is formed. If that\'s the case, then the para fraction would be 100% for 1,3,5 and 0% for 2,4,6. But then the order would be 2,4,6 (0%) followed by 1,3,5 (100%). But the problem says "increasing order of weight fraction of para," so from lowest to highest. So the order would be 2,4,6 (0%) first, then 1,3,5 (100%). But how to arrange 1,3,5 among themselves? If they all have 100% para, then they are the same. But maybe the problem is considering that some ortho/para directors have different para fractions. Wait, but the problem states "only one monobromo derivative is formed," which would imply that for each of these, only para is formed. But in reality, even with strong para directors, there\'s some ortho product. However, the problem might be simplifying, assuming that for each substituent, the directing is such that only one product is possible. For example, in toluene (1), ethylbenzene (5), and chlorobenzene (3), if the substituent is ortho/para-directing, but the problem states that only para is formed. Then, their para fractions are 100%, and the meta directors (2,4,6) have 0%. But then the order would be 2,4,6 < 1,3,5, but how to order 2,4,6 among themselves and 1,3,5 among themselves? If all meta directors have 0% para, they are equal, and all ortho/para have 100%, so they are equal. But the problem asks to arrange all six substances in order. Therefore, perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect. Maybe the problem allows for some variation even among the ortho/para directors. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering that only one product is formed, but that each substance forms only one monobromo derivative, which would mean that the substituent is such that only one position is possible. For example, if the substituent is in a position that makes all other positions equivalent. Wait, but in monosubstituted benzene, the positions are ortho (two positions), meta (two positions), and para (one position). If the substituent is a meta director, then bromine adds at the two meta positions, which are equivalent, leading to one product. If the substituent is an ortho/para director, then bromine can add at two ortho positions (equivalent) and one para position. But if the problem states that only one product is formed, then perhaps in some cases, the substituent is such that only para is possible. For example, if the substituent is very bulky, then para is favored. But in the given substituents, which are CH3, Cl, COOC2H5, NO2, C2H5, COOH. Among these, the ethyl group (C2H5) is more bulky than methyl. So maybe in ethylbenzene (5), the para product is the only one formed due to steric hindrance in the ortho positions, whereas in toluene (1) and chlorobenzene (3), both ortho and para are possible. But the problem states that only one product is formed. Therefore, perhaps for ethylbenzene, only para is formed, while for toluene and chlorobenzene, both ortho and para are possible, but the problem says only one product. This is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that when there are multiple substituents, but here all are monosubstituted. The problem states that "only one monobromo derivative is formed," which might mean that each starting material leads to a single product, regardless of directing effects. For example, if the substituent is a meta director, then the product is meta-bromo, and if it\'s ortho/para, then the product is para-bromo. Therefore, the para fraction would be 100% for ortho/para directors and 0% for meta directors. Then, the order would be meta directors (2,4,6) with 0% para, followed by ortho/para directors (1,3,5) with 100% para. But how to order 1,3,5? If they all have 100% para, they are the same. But maybe the problem considers that some ortho/para directors have different para fractions. For example, chlorobenzene (3) is ortho/para, but due to steric hindrance, maybe para is more favored than in toluene (1) or ethylbenzene (5). Wait, but ethyl is bulkier than methyl, so in ethylbenzene, para would be more favored than in toluene. Chlorine is smaller, so maybe in chlorobenzene, there\'s more ortho product compared to ethylbenzene. But the problem states that only one product is formed, so maybe in reality, for ethylbenzene, the para is the only product, while for toluene and chlorobenzene, there\'s a mix. But the problem says only one product is formed. Therefore, perhaps the assumption is that all ortho/para directors give 100% para, and meta directors give 0% para. Then, the order from lowest to highest para fraction would be:\n\n2 (COOC2H5, meta, 0%), 4 (NO2, meta, 0%), 6 (COOH, meta, 0%), then 1 (CH3, para), 3 (Cl, para), 5 (C2H5, para). But since 1,3,5 all have 100% para, they are equal. But the problem asks to arrange all six, so maybe there\'s another factor.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the para fraction varies even among the ortho/para directors. For example, stronger activating groups might lead to more para product. Let\'s think:\n\n- Toluene (1): methyl is a moderate activating group. Chlorobenzene (3): Cl is deactivating but ortho/para-directing. Ethylbenzene (5): ethyl is a stronger activating group than methyl. Wait, but ethyl is more bulky. So in ethylbenzene, para might be more favored due to steric hindrance. So the para fraction order among ortho/para directors could be: Cl (3) < CH3 (1) < C2H5 (5). Because Cl is deactivating, so the reaction is slower, but once it reacts, the para might be more favored. Wait, but para is generally favored over ortho in most cases. However, steric hindrance can affect this. For example, in toluene, methyl is not very bulky, so ortho and para are possible, but para is major. In ethylbenzene, ethyl is bulkier, so para is even more favored. Chlorine is a smaller group, so maybe ortho is more accessible, leading to lower para fraction compared to toluene and ethylbenzene. But if the problem states that only one product is formed, then perhaps all ortho/para directors give 100% para. But that\'s not realistic. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the para isomer is the only one formed for all ortho/para directors, so their para fractions are all 100%, and meta directors are 0%. Then the order would be 2,4,6 (0%) followed by 1,3,5 (100%). But since the problem asks to arrange all six, perhaps there\'s a mistake in the initial assumption.\n\nWait, another angle: maybe the problem is not about the actual yield but the theoretical yield based on directing effects. For example, meta directors have 0% para, while ortho/para directors have some para. But the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed, which would mean that for each compound, the reaction leads to a single product. Therefore, if the substituent is a meta director, the product is meta, and if it\'s ortho/para, the product is para. Therefore, the para fractions would be:\n\n1) Toluene: para (100%)\n\n2) COOC2H5: meta (0%)\n\n3) Cl: para (100%)\n\n4) NO2: meta (0%)\n\n5) C2H5: para (100%)\n\n6) COOH: meta (0%)\n\nThus, the order from lowest to highest para fraction would be 2,4,6 (0%) < 1,3,5 (100%). But since 1,3,5 are all 100%, they are equal. However, the problem might expect a specific order among the ortho/para directors based on the strength of the directing effect. For example, stronger activating groups might lead to higher para fractions. But if all are 100%, they are the same. Alternatively, maybe the problem considers that some substituents are more deactivating but still ortho/para directors (like Cl), leading to lower para yield compared to activating groups. But in reality, Cl is deactivating, so the reaction is slower, but once it occurs, the para might still be the major product. However, the problem states that only one product is formed, so perhaps all ortho/para directors give 100% para. Therefore, the order would be:\n\nSubstances with 0% para: 2,4,6 → order among them? Maybe based on substituent\'s meta-directing strength, but since all are 0%, they are equal. Then, the order would be 2 <4 <6 <1 <3 <5, but that doesn\'t make sense. Alternatively, the problem might have a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the para isomer\'s weight fraction depends on the number of possible positions. For example, in ortho/para directors, there are two ortho positions and one para position. If the problem assumes statistical distribution, para would be 1/3 (33.3%) and ortho 2/3. But in reality, para is often more than 1/3 due to steric factors. However, the problem states that only one product is formed, which contradicts this. Therefore, the initial assumption must be that the problem is idealized, and each substituent leads to a single product. Therefore, the answer would be that meta directors (2,4,6) have 0% para, and ortho/para directors (1,3,5) have 100% para. Therefore, the order from lowest to highest para fraction is 2,4,6 <1,3,5. But since 1,3,5 are all 100%, how to order them? Maybe based on the substituent\'s ability to activate the ring. For example, stronger activating groups might lead to higher yields, but the problem is about weight fraction of para in the product, not the reaction rate. If all three have 100% para, they are the same. But perhaps the problem expects a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the para isomer\'s weight fraction is influenced by the substituent\'s ability to stabilize the transition state. For example, stronger activating groups might lead to more para product. But if all ortho/para directors give 100% para, then they are the same. I\'m stuck here. Let me check the substituents again:\n\n1) Toluene (CH3): activating, ortho/para.\n\n3) Chlorobenzene (Cl): deactivating, ortho/para.\n\n5) Ethylbenzene (C2H5): activating, ortho/para.\n\nIf we consider that activating groups increase the reaction rate and para preference, while deactivating groups (like Cl) slow the reaction but still direct ortho/para. However, in terms of para isomer yield, maybe Cl being deactivating leads to less para compared to activating groups. But if the problem states only one product is formed, then all three would have 100% para. But perhaps in reality, chlorobenzene has a lower para/ortho ratio compared to toluene and ethylbenzene. For example, in toluene, para might be 60% and ortho 40%, while in chlorobenzene, para might be 45% and ortho 55%. But the problem says only one product is formed, so maybe it\'s assuming 100% para for all ortho/para directors. In that case, the order would be:\n\nLowest para: 2,4,6 (0%) → then 1,3,5 (100%). But since the problem asks to arrange all six, perhaps the order is 2 <4 <6 <3 <1 <5, based on some other reasoning. Wait, maybe the para fraction is influenced by the substituent\'s ability to stabilize the positive charge in the transition state. Stronger activating groups would stabilize the transition state better in the para position, leading to higher para yield. So among the ortho/para directors:\n\n- C2H5 (ethyl) is a stronger activating group (alkyl) than CH3 (methyl), which is stronger than Cl (which is deactivating). Therefore, the para yield would be highest for C2H5, then CH3, then Cl. But if the problem assumes 100% para for all, this doesn\'t matter. However, if the problem allows for some variation, then the order among ortho/para directors would be Cl (lowest para) < CH3 < C2H5 (highest para). Therefore, the overall order from lowest to highest para fraction would be:\n\nMeta directors (2,4,6) with 0% para: order among them? Maybe based on the strength of the meta-directing effect. For example, nitro groups are stronger meta directors than COOH, which is stronger than COOC2H5. But since all have 0% para, their order might not matter. However, the problem might expect them to be ordered based on their deactivating strength. But the question is about para fraction, which is 0% for all, so they are equal. Therefore, the final order would be:\n\n2 (COOC2H5), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH) (all 0% para) → then 3 (Cl), 1 (CH3), 5 (C2H5) (100% para). But if Cl has lower para yield than CH3 and C2H5, then the order would be 2,4,6 <3 <1 <5.\n\nBut I\'m not sure. The problem is a bit ambiguous because it states that only one monobromo derivative is formed, which implies 100% para for ortho/para directors. If that\'s the case, then the order is:\n\nSubstances with 0% para: 2,4,6\n\nSubstances with 100% para:1,3,5\n\nBut how to order within these groups? The problem might expect the meta directors to be ordered based on their deactivating effect, but since para is 0%, it\'s irrelevant. Similarly, the ortho/para directors might be ordered based on activating effect, but para is 100% for all. Therefore, the answer might be:\n\nIncreasing order of para isomer yield: 2 <4 <6 <3 <1 <5\n\nBut I\'m not confident. Alternatively, maybe the para isomer yield is higher for stronger activating groups. So among ortho/para directors, the order from lowest to highest para would be Cl (3) < CH3 (1) < C2H5 (5). Therefore, the full order would be:\n\n2 (COOC2H5, 0%), 4 (NO2, 0%), 6 (COOH, 0%), 3 (Cl, 100%), 1 (CH3, 100%), 5 (C2H5, 100%)\n\nBut this doesn\'t make sense because 100% is higher than 0%. Wait, no. The order is increasing, so from lowest to highest. So the meta directors (0%) come first, then the ortho/para directors (100%). But within the ortho/para directors, if their para fractions are different, say Cl has lower para than CH3, which has lower than C2H5, then the order would be 2,4,6 <3 <1 <5. But if all ortho/para directors have 100%, then they are all after the meta directors. But the problem states to arrange all six substances, so perhaps the intended answer is:\n\n2,4,6 (0% para) in some order, then 3,1,5 (100% para) in order of increasing activating strength. Since Cl is deactivating, then CH3 is activating, and C2H5 is more activating. So the order from lowest to highest para would be:\n\n2 (COOC2H5), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH), 3 (Cl), 1 (CH3), 5 (C2H5)\n\nThis is because among the meta directors, their order might be based on the strength of the deactivating effect, but since para is 0%, it\'s irrelevant. However, the problem might just list them in the order given, but I think the intended answer is that meta directors have 0% para, and ortho/para have 100%, with the order among ortho/para based on activating strength: Cl (weakest, so lowest para if not 100%), then CH3, then C2H5. But if all are 100%, then they are equal. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the para isomer\'s yield is influenced by the substituent\'s ability to stabilize the transition state. Stronger activating groups lead to more para product. So among ortho/para directors, the order of para yield would be Cl < CH3 < C2H5. Therefore, the full order from lowest to highest para yield is:\n\n6 (COOH, 0%) <4 (NO2, 0%) <2 (COOC2H5, 0%) <3 (Cl, para) <1 (CH3, para) <5 (C2H5, para)\n\nBut why would COOH be lower than NO2? Wait, nitro is a stronger deactivating group than COOH? Actually, nitro is a stronger deactivating group than COOH. Wait, nitro is a strong meta director, as is COOH. So their para fractions are both 0%. The order among meta directors might not matter, but if the problem expects them ordered by deactivating strength, then from strongest to weakest deactivating: NO2 > COOH > COOC2H5. Therefore, their para fractions are all 0%, but perhaps the problem lists them in order of deactivating strength. But the question is about increasing para fraction, which is 0% for all, so their order doesn\'t affect the para fraction. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n2 (COOC2H5), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH), 3 (Cl), 1 (CH3), 5 (C2H5)\n\nThis is based on the assumption that meta directors (2,4,6) have 0% para, ordered arbitrarily, followed by ortho/para directors ordered by increasing activating strength (Cl < CH3 < C2H5), leading to increasing para yield.

To determine the order of substances in increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer during electrophilic bromination, we analyze the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring:

1. **Meta-Directing Groups (0% para-isomer):**  
   - **C6H5-COOC2H5 (2)**: The ester group is a strong meta-director.  
   - **C6H5-NO2 (4)**: The nitro group is a very strong meta-director.  
   - **C6H5-COOH (6)**: The carboxylic acid group is a strong meta-director.  
   These substituents direct bromine exclusively to the meta position, resulting in **0% para-isomer**.

2. **Ortho/Para-Directing Groups (100% para-isomer):**  
   - **C6H5-Cl (3)**: Chlorine is deactivating but ortho/para-directing. Steric hindrance and resonance effects favor the para product.  
   - **C6H5-CH3 (1)**: The methyl group is activating and ortho/para-directing. Para is favored due to reduced steric hindrance.  
   - **C6H5-C2H5 (5)**: The ethyl group is more bulky than methyl, further favoring the para position.  

**Order of Increasing Para-Isomer Yield:**  
The meta-directing groups (2, 4, 6) have **0% para-isomer**, while the ortho/para-directing groups (3, 1, 5) have **100% para-isomer**. Among the ortho/para directors, the para yield increases with the substituent's activating strength and steric bulk:  
- **Cl (3)** < **CH3 (1)** < **C2H5 (5)**.  

**Final Order:**  
**C6H5-COOC2H5 (2) < C6H5-NO2 (4) < C6H5-COOH (6) < C6H5-Cl (3) < C6H5-CH3 (1) < C6H5-C2H5 (5)**  

**Answer:**  
\boxed{2 < 4 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5}

Wait, but the problem states that "only one monobromo derivative is formed." That suggests that for each compound, the bromination leads to a single product. If that's the case, then perhaps some substituents are so strongly directing that only para is formed, or maybe the substituent's position allows only one possible para position. Wait, but in a monosubstituted benzene, there are three possible positions: ortho (two positions), meta (two positions), and para (one position). However, if the substituent is a meta director, then the bromine would add in the meta position. But if the substituent is ortho/para, then bromine can add in ortho or para. But the problem says only one monobromo derivative is formed. That would mean that either the substituent is such that only para is possible (but how?), or perhaps the substituent is in a position that blocks ortho positions, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, maybe under certain conditions, the para product is the only one formed. But in reality, even with strong directing groups, you get a mixture. However, the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. So perhaps the substituent is such that the para position is the only possible one. Wait, maybe when the substituent is a meta director, the bromine adds meta, but if the substituent is in a position that allows only one possible meta position? No, in a monosubstituted benzene, there are two meta positions. Wait, but if the substituent is a meta director, then the bromine would add in the meta positions, which are two equivalent positions (positions 3 and 5), but those would lead to the same product. Wait, no. If the original substituent is at position 1, then the meta positions would be 3 and 5. Adding bromine at either 3 or 5 would result in two different products, but they are actually the same due to symmetry. Wait, no. Let me think. If the substituent is at position 1, then adding bromine at position 3 would give a structure that is equivalent to adding at position 5 upon rotation. So, in that case, the meta product would be a single product. Similarly, if the substituent is a meta director, then the bromine would add in the meta position, which would be a single product. But if the substituent is an ortho/para director, then adding bromine in ortho (positions 2 and 6) would lead to two equivalent positions (so one product) and para (position 4) would be another product. But the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. Therefore, perhaps in some cases, the substituent is such that only para is possible, or only ortho, but how?

Wait, maybe the problem is simplifying and assuming that for each substituent, only the major product is considered, and the minor products are negligible. So, for example, if a substituent is a strong para director, then the para product is the only one formed (in the context of the problem). Alternatively, maybe when the substituent is a meta director, the product is meta, and when it's ortho/para, the product is para. But that's not necessarily the case. Let me check each substituent:

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene): methyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. Bromination would occur at ortho and para. However, in practice, the para product is the major product. But if the problem states that only one product is formed, perhaps it's assuming para is the only product. But in reality, there's a mixture. However, maybe under certain conditions (like excess Br2 and high temperature), the more stable para isomer is the major product. But the problem says "only one monobromo derivative is formed," which might be an idealization. So, perhaps for toluene, the product is para-bromotoluene.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate): The ester group (-COOC2H5) is a meta director (since it's an electron-withdrawing group). So bromine would add at the meta position. Since there are two equivalent meta positions, but they would lead to the same product due to symmetry. So only one product is formed here: meta-bromoethylbenzoate.

3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene): Chlorine is a deactivating (due to electronegativity) but ortho/para-directing (due to resonance) group. So bromine would add at ortho and para positions. However, in practice, para is favored over ortho because of less steric hindrance. But again, if the problem states only one product, maybe para is the only product. But in reality, there's a mixture, but perhaps here it's considered that para is the main product.

4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene): Nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. Bromine adds at meta, leading to one product.

5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene): Ethyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. Similar to toluene, bromine would add at ortho and para. Para is favored, so perhaps only para product is considered here.

6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid): The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. Bromine adds at meta, leading to one product.

Now, the question is to arrange these substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. Wait, but if some substituents are meta directors, then their para fraction would be zero. For example, nitro, COOH, and COOC2H5 are meta directors, so their bromination would not produce para isomers. Therefore, their para fraction is zero. On the other hand, the ortho/para directors (CH3, C2H5, Cl) would have some para fraction. But the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. So perhaps in the case of meta directors, the product is meta, and in the case of ortho/para directors, the product is para. If that's the case, then the para fraction would be 100% for the ortho/para directors and 0% for the meta directors. But then, how to order them? The problem says "increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer." So the meta directors (substances 2,4,6) would have 0% para, and the ortho/para directors (1,3,5) would have 100% para. But that can't be, because in reality, even ortho/para directors have a mixture. But the problem states "only one monobromo derivative is formed," which might mean that for each substance, only one product is possible. So perhaps in some cases, the substituent is such that only para is possible. For example, if the substituent is in a position that blocks ortho positions, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that when the substituent is ortho/para-directing, the para product is the only one formed (maybe under certain conditions), and when it's meta-directing, the meta product is formed. If that's the case, then the para fraction would be 100% for 1,3,5 and 0% for 2,4,6. But then the order would be 2,4,6 (0%) followed by 1,3,5 (100%). But the problem says "increasing order of weight fraction of para," so from lowest to highest. So the order would be 2,4,6 (0%) first, then 1,3,5 (100%). But how to arrange 1,3,5 among themselves? If they all have 100% para, then they are the same. But maybe the problem is considering that some ortho/para directors have different para fractions. Wait, but the problem states "only one monobromo derivative is formed," which would imply that for each of these, only para is formed. But in reality, even with strong para directors, there's some ortho product. However, the problem might be simplifying, assuming that for each substituent, the directing is such that only one product is possible. For example, in toluene (1), ethylbenzene (5), and chlorobenzene (3), if the substituent is ortho/para-directing, but the problem states that only para is formed. Then, their para fractions are 100%, and the meta directors (2,4,6) have 0%. But then the order would be 2,4,6 < 1,3,5, but how to order 2,4,6 among themselves and 1,3,5 among themselves? If all meta directors have 0% para, they are equal, and all ortho/para have 100%, so they are equal. But the problem asks to arrange all six substances in order. Therefore, perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect. Maybe the problem allows for some variation even among the ortho/para directors. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering that only one product is formed, but that each substance forms only one monobromo derivative, which would mean that the substituent is such that only one position is possible. For example, if the substituent is in a position that makes all other positions equivalent. Wait, but in monosubstituted benzene, the positions are ortho (two positions), meta (two positions), and para (one position). If the substituent is a meta director, then bromine adds at the two meta positions, which are equivalent, leading to one product. If the substituent is an ortho/para director, then bromine can add at two ortho positions (equivalent) and one para position. But if the problem states that only one product is formed, then perhaps in some cases, the substituent is such that only para is possible. For example, if the substituent is very bulky, then para is favored. But in the given substituents, which are CH3, Cl, COOC2H5, NO2, C2H5, COOH. Among these, the ethyl group (C2H5) is more bulky than methyl. So maybe in ethylbenzene (5), the para product is the only one formed due to steric hindrance in the ortho positions, whereas in toluene (1) and chlorobenzene (3), both ortho and para are possible. But the problem states that only one product is formed. Therefore, perhaps for ethylbenzene, only para is formed, while for toluene and chlorobenzene, both ortho and para are possible, but the problem says only one product. This is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the key is that when there are multiple substituents, but here all are monosubstituted. The problem states that "only one monobromo derivative is formed," which might mean that each starting material leads to a single product, regardless of directing effects. For example, if the substituent is a meta director, then the product is meta-bromo, and if it's ortho/para, then the product is para-bromo. Therefore, the para fraction would be 100% for ortho/para directors and 0% for meta directors. Then, the order would be meta directors (2,4,6) with 0% para, followed by ortho/para directors (1,3,5) with 100% para. But how to order 1,3,5? If they all have 100% para, they are the same. But maybe the problem considers that some ortho/para directors have different para fractions. For example, chlorobenzene (3) is ortho/para, but due to steric hindrance, maybe para is more favored than in toluene (1) or ethylbenzene (5). Wait, but ethyl is bulkier than methyl, so in ethylbenzene, para would be more favored than in toluene. Chlorine is smaller, so maybe in chlorobenzene, there's more ortho product compared to ethylbenzene. But the problem states that only one product is formed, so maybe in reality, for ethylbenzene, the para is the only product, while for toluene and chlorobenzene, there's a mix. But the problem says only one product is formed. Therefore, perhaps the assumption is that all ortho/para directors give 100% para, and meta directors give 0% para. Then, the order from lowest to highest para fraction would be:

2 (COOC2H5, meta, 0%), 4 (NO2, meta, 0%), 6 (COOH, meta, 0%), then 1 (CH3, para), 3 (Cl, para), 5 (C2H5, para). But since 1,3,5 all have 100% para, they are equal. But the problem asks to arrange all six, so maybe there's another factor.

Alternatively, maybe the para fraction varies even among the ortho/para directors. For example, stronger activating groups might lead to more para product. Let's think:

- Toluene (1): methyl is a moderate activating group. Chlorobenzene (3): Cl is deactivating but ortho/para-directing. Ethylbenzene (5): ethyl is a stronger activating group than methyl. Wait, but ethyl is more bulky. So in ethylbenzene, para might be more favored due to steric hindrance. So the para fraction order among ortho/para directors could be: Cl (3) < CH3 (1) < C2H5 (5). Because Cl is deactivating, so the reaction is slower, but once it reacts, the para might be more favored. Wait, but para is generally favored over ortho in most cases. However, steric hindrance can affect this. For example, in toluene, methyl is not very bulky, so ortho and para are possible, but para is major. In ethylbenzene, ethyl is bulkier, so para is even more favored. Chlorine is a smaller group, so maybe ortho is more accessible, leading to lower para fraction compared to toluene and ethylbenzene. But if the problem states that only one product is formed, then perhaps all ortho/para directors give 100% para. But that's not realistic. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the para isomer is the only one formed for all ortho/para directors, so their para fractions are all 100%, and meta directors are 0%. Then the order would be 2,4,6 (0%) followed by 1,3,5 (100%). But since the problem asks to arrange all six, perhaps there's a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, another angle: maybe the problem is not about the actual yield but the theoretical yield based on directing effects. For example, meta directors have 0% para, while ortho/para directors have some para. But the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed, which would mean that for each compound, the reaction leads to a single product. Therefore, if the substituent is a meta director, the product is meta, and if it's ortho/para, the product is para. Therefore, the para fractions would be:

1) Toluene: para (100%)

2) COOC2H5: meta (0%)

3) Cl: para (100%)

4) NO2: meta (0%)

5) C2H5: para (100%)

6) COOH: meta (0%)

Thus, the order from lowest to highest para fraction would be 2,4,6 (0%) < 1,3,5 (100%). But since 1,3,5 are all 100%, they are equal. However, the problem might expect a specific order among the ortho/para directors based on the strength of the directing effect. For example, stronger activating groups might lead to higher para fractions. But if all are 100%, they are the same. Alternatively, maybe the problem considers that some substituents are more deactivating but still ortho/para directors (like Cl), leading to lower para yield compared to activating groups. But in reality, Cl is deactivating, so the reaction is slower, but once it occurs, the para might still be the major product. However, the problem states that only one product is formed, so perhaps all ortho/para directors give 100% para. Therefore, the order would be:

Substances with 0% para: 2,4,6 → order among them? Maybe based on substituent's meta-directing strength, but since all are 0%, they are equal. Then, the order would be 2 <4 <6 <1 <3 <5, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the problem might have a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the para isomer's weight fraction depends on the number of possible positions. For example, in ortho/para directors, there are two ortho positions and one para position. If the problem assumes statistical distribution, para would be 1/3 (33.3%) and ortho 2/3. But in reality, para is often more than 1/3 due to steric factors. However, the problem states that only one product is formed, which contradicts this. Therefore, the initial assumption must be that the problem is idealized, and each substituent leads to a single product. Therefore, the answer would be that meta directors (2,4,6) have 0% para, and ortho/para directors (1,3,5) have 100% para. Therefore, the order from lowest to highest para fraction is 2,4,6 <1,3,5. But since 1,3,5 are all 100%, how to order them? Maybe based on the substituent's ability to activate the ring. For example, stronger activating groups might lead to higher yields, but the problem is about weight fraction of para in the product, not the reaction rate. If all three have 100% para, they are the same. But perhaps the problem expects a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe the para isomer's weight fraction is influenced by the substituent's ability to stabilize the transition state. For example, stronger activating groups might lead to more para product. But if all ortho/para directors give 100% para, then they are the same. I'm stuck here. Let me check the substituents again:

1) Toluene (CH3): activating, ortho/para.

3) Chlorobenzene (Cl): deactivating, ortho/para.

5) Ethylbenzene (C2H5): activating, ortho/para.

If we consider that activating groups increase the reaction rate and para preference, while deactivating groups (like Cl) slow the reaction but still direct ortho/para. However, in terms of para isomer yield, maybe Cl being deactivating leads to less para compared to activating groups. But if the problem states only one product is formed, then all three would have 100% para. But perhaps in reality, chlorobenzene has a lower para/ortho ratio compared to toluene and ethylbenzene. For example, in toluene, para might be 60% and ortho 40%, while in chlorobenzene, para might be 45% and ortho 55%. But the problem says only one product is formed, so maybe it's assuming 100% para for all ortho/para directors. In that case, the order would be:

Lowest para: 2,4,6 (0%) → then 1,3,5 (100%). But since the problem asks to arrange all six, perhaps the order is 2 <4 <6 <3 <1 <5, based on some other reasoning. Wait, maybe the para fraction is influenced by the substituent's ability to stabilize the positive charge in the transition state. Stronger activating groups would stabilize the transition state better in the para position, leading to higher para yield. So among the ortho/para directors:

- C2H5 (ethyl) is a stronger activating group (alkyl) than CH3 (methyl), which is stronger than Cl (which is deactivating). Therefore, the para yield would be highest for C2H5, then CH3, then Cl. But if the problem assumes 100% para for all, this doesn't matter. However, if the problem allows for some variation, then the order among ortho/para directors would be Cl (lowest para) < CH3 < C2H5 (highest para). Therefore, the overall order from lowest to highest para fraction would be:

Meta directors (2,4,6) with 0% para: order among them? Maybe based on the strength of the meta-directing effect. For example, nitro groups are stronger meta directors than COOH, which is stronger than COOC2H5. But since all have 0% para, their order might not matter. However, the problem might expect them to be ordered based on their deactivating strength. But the question is about para fraction, which is 0% for all, so they are equal. Therefore, the final order would be:

2 (COOC2H5), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH) (all 0% para) → then 3 (Cl), 1 (CH3), 5 (C2H5) (100% para). But if Cl has lower para yield than CH3 and C2H5, then the order would be 2,4,6 <3 <1 <5.

But I'm not sure. The problem is a bit ambiguous because it states that only one monobromo derivative is formed, which implies 100% para for ortho/para directors. If that's the case, then the order is:

Substances with 0% para: 2,4,6

Substances with 100% para:1,3,5

But how to order within these groups? The problem might expect the meta directors to be ordered based on their deactivating effect, but since para is 0%, it's irrelevant. Similarly, the ortho/para directors might be ordered based on activating effect, but para is 100% for all. Therefore, the answer might be:

Increasing order of para isomer yield: 2 <4 <6 <3 <1 <5

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe the para isomer yield is higher for stronger activating groups. So among ortho/para directors, the order from lowest to highest para would be Cl (3) < CH3 (1) < C2H5 (5). Therefore, the full order would be:

2 (COOC2H5, 0%), 4 (NO2, 0%), 6 (COOH, 0%), 3 (Cl, 100%), 1 (CH3, 100%), 5 (C2H5, 100%)

But this doesn't make sense because 100% is higher than 0%. Wait, no. The order is increasing, so from lowest to highest. So the meta directors (0%) come first, then the ortho/para directors (100%). But within the ortho/para directors, if their para fractions are different, say Cl has lower para than CH3, which has lower than C2H5, then the order would be 2,4,6 <3 <1 <5. But if all ortho/para directors have 100%, then they are all after the meta directors. But the problem states to arrange all six substances, so perhaps the intended answer is:

2,4,6 (0% para) in some order, then 3,1,5 (100% para) in order of increasing activating strength. Since Cl is deactivating, then CH3 is activating, and C2H5 is more activating. So the order from lowest to highest para would be:

2 (COOC2H5), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH), 3 (Cl), 1 (CH3), 5 (C2H5)

This is because among the meta directors, their order might be based on the strength of the deactivating effect, but since para is 0%, it's irrelevant. However, the problem might just list them in the order given, but I think the intended answer is that meta directors have 0% para, and ortho/para have 100%, with the order among ortho/para based on activating strength: Cl (weakest, so lowest para if not 100%), then CH3, then C2H5. But if all are 100%, then they are equal. This is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the para isomer's yield is influenced by the substituent's ability to stabilize the transition state. Stronger activating groups lead to more para product. So among ortho/para directors, the order of para yield would be Cl < CH3 < C2H5. Therefore, the full order from lowest to highest para yield is:

6 (COOH, 0%) <4 (NO2, 0%) <2 (COOC2H5, 0%) <3 (Cl, para) <1 (CH3, para) <5 (C2H5, para)

But why would COOH be lower than NO2? Wait, nitro is a stronger deactivating group than COOH? Actually, nitro is a stronger deactivating group than COOH. Wait, nitro is a strong meta director, as is COOH. So their para fractions are both 0%. The order among meta directors might not matter, but if the problem expects them ordered by deactivating strength, then from strongest to weakest deactivating: NO2 > COOH > COOC2H5. Therefore, their para fractions are all 0%, but perhaps the problem lists them in order of deactivating strength. But the question is about increasing para fraction, which is 0% for all, so their order doesn't affect the para fraction. Therefore, the answer is:

2 (COOC2H5), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH), 3 (Cl), 1 (CH3), 5 (C2H5)

This is based on the assumption that meta directors (2,4,6) have 0% para, ordered arbitrarily, followed by ortho/para directors ordered by increasing activating strength (Cl < CH3 < C2H5), leading to increasing para yield. But if all ortho/para directors have 100% para, then their order is irrelevant. However, the problem might expect this specific order based on the substituent's directing effects and steric factors.

This makes the ring deactivated and meta-directing. Therefore, bromine would add in the meta position relative to the COOC2H5 group. However, if the substituent is meta-directing, then the para position relative to the substituent would not be a major product. Wait, but in meta-directing groups, the incoming electrophile attacks the meta position. So, for example, if the substituent is at position 1, the bromine would add at position 3 and 5 (if possible), but since it\'s a single substituent, perhaps only one position is possible. Wait, but benzene is symmetric. If the substituent is in position 1, then meta positions would be 3 and 5. However, due to the symmetry, adding bromine at 3 or 5 would be equivalent. But in the case of a single substituent, the para position (position 4) would not be meta to the substituent. Wait, perhaps I need to clarify.\n\nWait, when a substituent is meta-directing, the incoming electrophile attacks the meta positions relative to the substituent. For example, if the substituent is at position 1, the meta positions are 3 and 5. However, in a monosubstituted benzene, the positions are equivalent due to the ring\'s symmetry, so the product would be a single meta isomer. But in reality, when a substituent is meta-directing, the para position (position 4) is not a meta position. So, if the substituent is at position 1, the meta positions are 3 and 5, which are equivalent. Therefore, the product would be a single meta isomer. Therefore, in this case, the COOC2H5 group would direct bromine to the meta position, so the para isomer (relative to the substituent) would not form. Therefore, the para isomer\'s yield would be zero? But the question states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. So, if the substituent is meta-directing, then the product is meta, so the para isomer isn\'t formed. But the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. Wait, perhaps I\'m confused here. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the para isomer refers to the bromine being in the para position relative to the substituent. So, if the substituent is at position 1, the para position is 4. If the substituent is meta-directing, then the bromine would be at position 3 or 5 (meta to substituent), but not at position 4 (para). Therefore, the para isomer would not be formed. So, in that case, the weight fraction of the para isomer would be zero. But the question says "only one monobromo derivative is formed," which might mean that in some cases, the substituent is such that only para is possible. Wait, but for meta-directing groups, the product is meta, so the para isomer isn\'t formed. For ortho/para directors, the product could be ortho or para. However, in some cases, steric hindrance might prevent ortho substitution, leading to only para. For example, in toluene (methyl group), bromination gives a mixture of ortho and para, but if the substituent is bulky, maybe the para is favored. But the question states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. So perhaps in some cases, the substituent is so bulky that ortho is not possible, leading to only para. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a strong enough director that only one position is possible. For example, in nitro groups (meta director), the product is meta, so para isn\'t formed. For substituents that are ortho/para directors, if the substituent is bulky, like tert-butyl, then para is the major product. But in the given compounds, substituents vary. Let\'s list each substituent and their directing effects:\n\n1) C6H5-CH3: Methyl group, activating, ortho/para director. Bromine can add ortho or para. However, in practice, para is favored over ortho due to less steric hindrance. But if the question states only one product is formed, perhaps in some cases, like when the substituent is very bulky, but methyl is not. So maybe in toluene, both ortho and para are possible, but the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. Wait, that\'s confusing. The problem says "it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed". So perhaps each of these substituents, when brominated, gives only one product. That would mean that the substituent is such that only one position is possible. For example, if the substituent is a meta director, then the bromine adds only in the meta position, leading to a single product. If the substituent is an ortho/para director but steric hindrance prevents ortho, then only para is formed. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is in a position that allows only one isomer due to symmetry. Wait, but all substituents are monosubstituted, so the ring has a single substituent. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simplifying the scenario. For example, in some cases, even if the substituent is ortho/para directing, the para isomer is the only one formed. For example, if the substituent is a strong activating group but bulky, like tert-butyl, then para is the major product. But in the given substituents, we have methyl (1), ethyl (5), which are not very bulky. COOC2H5 (2), Cl (3), NO2 (4), COOH (6). Let\'s analyze each:\n\n1) Toluene (C6H5-CH3): Methyl is an activating, ortho/para director. Bromine would add ortho and para. However, if the problem states only one product is formed, perhaps in this case, the para is the only product. But in reality, toluene bromination gives a mixture. But maybe under certain conditions (like excess Br2 and a catalyst), the para is major. But the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. So perhaps for each substituent, the directing effect is such that only one position is possible. For example, if the substituent is meta-directing, then only meta is formed. If it\'s ortho/para, but steric hindrance makes only para possible. Let\'s check each substituent:\n\n1) Methyl: ortho/para director. If the methyl is not bulky, then both ortho and para would form. But the problem says only one product. So maybe in this case, the para is the only product. But why? Maybe because the problem is simplifying, assuming that para is the major product. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent\'s position is such that only para is possible. Wait, but in reality, toluene gives both ortho and para. The problem\'s statement that only one monobromo derivative is formed might be a simplification for the sake of the problem, perhaps indicating that each substituent leads to a single product, so we can ignore the actual mixture. But then, how does that affect the para isomer\'s yield? If the substituent is meta-directing, then the product is meta, so para yield is zero. If the substituent is ortho/para, then para is formed. But if the problem states that only one product is formed, then for ortho/para directors, perhaps only para is formed. But why? Maybe because the substituent is bulky enough to prevent ortho substitution. Let\'s check the substituents:\n\n1) Methyl: not bulky, so ortho and para possible. But the problem says only one product. Hmm. Maybe the problem is assuming that for all ortho/para directors, only para is formed, and for meta directors, only meta. But that\'s not accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that when there\'s excess bromine, multiple substitutions could occur, but the question specifies monobromo. Wait, the problem says "only one monobromo derivative is formed". So each of these compounds, when brominated, gives a single monobromo product. That must be due to the directing effect leading to only one possible position. For example, if the substituent is a meta director, then the bromine adds only in the meta position, leading to a single product. If the substituent is an ortho/para director, but due to steric hindrance, only para is possible. Let\'s check each substituent:\n\n1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene): Methyl is ortho/para director. If the methyl is not bulky, then both ortho and para would form. But the problem states only one product. So perhaps in this case, the para is the only product. But why? Maybe the problem is simplifying, assuming that para is the major product. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is such that the para position is the only one possible. For example, if the substituent is in a position that makes ortho impossible. But that\'s not the case here. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that when there\'s a substituent that is a strong activating group, the para is the major product. But in reality, toluene gives a mixture. However, the problem states that only one product is formed. Therefore, perhaps the assumption is that for each substituent, the directing effect is such that only one product is possible. For example:\n\n- For meta directors (like NO2, COOH, COOC2H5, Cl?), the bromine adds in the meta position, so the para isomer (relative to the substituent) is not formed. Therefore, the yield of para isomer is zero.\n\nWait, but Cl is a meta director? No, wait, halogens are ortho/para directors despite being deactivating. So Cl is ortho/para director. So for substituent 3 (Cl), bromine would add ortho or para. But the problem states only one product is formed. So perhaps in this case, only para is formed. But why? Maybe because the Cl is not bulky, so both ortho and para are possible, but the problem\'s assumption is that only one product is formed. This is confusing. Let me list each substituent\'s directing effect and whether they are activating or deactivating:\n\n1) CH3: Activating, ortho/para\n2) COOC2H5: Deactivating (ester group), meta\n3) Cl: Deactivating (due to electronegativity), but ortho/para director (due to resonance)\n4) NO2: Deactivating, meta\n5) C2H5: Activating (alkyl group), ortho/para\n6) COOH: Deactivating (carboxylic acid), meta\n\nSo substituents 1,3,5 are ortho/para directors (activating or Cl), and 2,4,6 are meta directors (deactivating).\n\nNow, the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. For meta directors (2,4,6), the bromine would add in the meta position relative to the substituent. Since the substituent is at position 1, the meta positions are 3 and 5. However, due to the ring\'s symmetry, adding bromine at 3 or 5 would result in the same product. Therefore, even though there are two possible positions, the product is considered a single isomer because they are equivalent. So for meta directors, the product is the meta isomer, and the para isomer (position 4) is not formed, so its yield is zero.\n\nFor ortho/para directors (1,3,5), bromine can add ortho (position 2) or para (position 4) relative to the substituent. However, the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. This suggests that in these cases, either ortho or para is formed exclusively. For example, if the substituent is bulky, para is favored. Let\'s check the substituents:\n\n1) CH3: Methyl is a small group, so both ortho and para are possible, but maybe under certain conditions, para is major. However, the problem states only one product, so perhaps para is the only product. But in reality, toluene bromination gives a mixture. The problem\'s assumption might be that para is the only product for ortho/para directors. Alternatively, maybe steric hindrance is considered. For example, in toluene, the para position is less hindered, so only para forms. But methyl is not that bulky. However, if the problem states that only one product is formed, we have to go with that.\n\n3) Cl: Chlorine is an ortho/para director. Chlorine is more electronegative, but still directs ortho/para. However, due to its size, maybe para is favored. But again, in reality, both ortho and para are possible. But the problem says only one product. So perhaps para is formed.\n\n5) C2H5: Ethyl group is larger than methyl. So maybe in this case, the ethyl group is bulky enough to hinder ortho substitution, leading to only para product. So for substituent 5, para is formed.\n\nTherefore, for substituents 1,3,5 (ortho/para directors), the para isomer is formed, and for substituents 2,4,6 (meta directors), the meta isomer is formed, so the para isomer\'s yield is zero.\n\nBut the question asks to arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. So the para yield would be zero for 2,4,6, and some positive value for 1,3,5. But wait, if for 1,3,5, the para is the only product, then their para yield is 100%. But the problem says "weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer". So the para yield would be 100% for 1,3,5 and 0% for 2,4,6. Therefore, the order from lowest to highest para yield would be 2,4,6 (0%) followed by 1,3,5 (100%). But the problem says "increasing order of weight fraction of the para-isomer", so the order would be 2,4,6 first (all 0%), then 1,3,5 (100%). But how to differentiate between 1,3,5? Are their para yields all 100%? But maybe there\'s a mistake here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is more nuanced. For example, even among ortho/para directors, the ratio of para to ortho can vary. For example, toluene (methyl) gives more para than ortho, but not 100%. Similarly, ethyl group (substituent 5) might have more para due to steric hindrance. Chlorine (substituent 3) might have a different ratio. However, the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed, implying that for each substituent, only one product is possible. Therefore, perhaps for substituents 1,3,5, the para isomer is the only product (100% yield), and for 2,4,6, the para isomer is 0%. Therefore, all meta directors have 0% para, and ortho/para directors have 100% para. In that case, the order from lowest to highest would be 2,4,6 (0%) followed by 1,3,5 (100%). But the problem asks to arrange all six substances in order of increasing para yield. So the order would be 2,4,6 < 1,3,5. But how to order 2,4,6 among themselves? They all have 0% para. Similarly, 1,3,5 all have 100% para. But maybe there\'s a mistake in the problem\'s assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the para yield is not exactly 100% or 0%, but varies based on the substituent\'s directing strength. For example, some meta directors might allow a small amount of para isomer, but the problem states only one product is formed. Therefore, the initial assumption is that for meta directors, para is 0%, and for ortho/para directors, para is 100%. Therefore, the order would be 2,4,6 (0%) < 1,3,5 (100%). But since the problem lists six substances, we need to arrange all six. However, if all meta directors have 0% and all ortho/para have 100%, then the order is 2,4,6 < 1,3,5. But the problem might expect a more detailed order. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering that even among ortho/para directors, the para yield varies. For example, stronger activating groups might have higher para yields. Let\'s think:\n\nSubstituents 1 (CH3), 3 (Cl), 5 (C2H5) are ortho/para directors. Among these, Cl is deactivating but ortho/para. The activating groups (CH3, C2H5) are stronger directors. Maybe the para yield is higher for stronger activating groups. However, Cl, being deactivating, might have a lower para yield. Wait, but the problem states that only one product is formed. So if the substituent is Cl, and it\'s ortho/para director, but the problem says only one product, then perhaps for Cl, the para is formed. But in reality, Cl can direct both ortho and para. However, the problem\'s condition might override this, leading to only para. Alternatively, maybe the para yield is higher for more activating groups. For example, methyl and ethyl are stronger activating than Cl, so their para yields are higher. But if the problem states only one product, then all three (1,3,5) have 100% para. But perhaps the problem is not considering that, and instead, the actual para yields vary. Let\'s think without the problem\'s condition for a moment.\n\nIn reality:\n\n- Toluene (CH3): ortho and para, with para being major (like 60-70% para, 30-40% ortho).\n- Chlorobenzene (Cl): ortho and para, but due to deactivation, the reaction is slower. The para might be slightly favored over ortho, but both are formed.\n- Ethylbenzene (C2H5): similar to toluene, but ethyl is slightly bulkier, so para might be more favored (higher para % than toluene).\n\nBut the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. So perhaps in this hypothetical scenario, for substituents that are ortho/para directors, only para is formed (due to steric hindrance preventing ortho), and for meta directors, only meta. Therefore, the para yield would be 100% for 1,3,5 and 0% for 2,4,6. Hence, the order from lowest to highest para yield would be 2,4,6 < 1,3,5. But since the problem lists six substances, and 2,4,6 are all 0%, and 1,3,5 are 100%, how to order them? The problem might expect the order based on the substituent\'s ability to direct para, but if they are all 100%, they are equal. However, perhaps there\'s a mistake in the problem\'s interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the para yield is not 100% for all ortho/para directors. Let\'s consider that even among ortho/para directors, the para yield varies. For example:\n\n- For substituent 5 (C2H5), ethyl is bulkier than methyl (1), so para is more favored (higher yield).\n- For substituent 1 (CH3), para is less favored than 5 but more than 3.\n- For substituent 3 (Cl), being a deactivating group, the para yield might be lower than activating groups. Wait, but Cl is ortho/para director. However, because it\'s deactivating, the reaction is slower, but the directing is still ortho/para. In terms of yield, if the reaction is slower, but the para is still formed, but maybe the ratio of para to ortho is different. However, the problem states only one product is formed, so perhaps in this case, para is the only product. But I\'m getting stuck here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the para yield is determined by the substituent\'s ability to stabilize the transition state. Stronger activating groups (like methyl, ethyl) better stabilize the transition state for para substitution, leading to higher para yields. Chlorine, being deactivating, might lead to lower para yield compared to methyl and ethyl. But again, the problem\'s condition of only one product complicates this.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that for substituents that are meta directors, the para isomer is not formed (0% yield), and for ortho/para directors, the para isomer is formed (100% yield). Therefore, the order would be:\n\nLowest para yield: 2 (COOC2H5), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH) (all 0%)\n\nThen higher para yield: 1 (CH3), 3 (Cl), 5 (C2H5) (all 100%)\n\nBut since the problem asks to arrange all six in order, we need to sort the three meta directors and the three ortho/para directors. Among the meta directors (2,4,6), perhaps their para yields are all 0%, so they are equal. Similarly, among the ortho/para directors (1,3,5), their para yields are all 100%. But the problem might expect a specific order based on the substituent\'s effects. For example, maybe among the ortho/para directors, the para yield is higher for more activating groups. So ethyl (5) is more activating than methyl (1), so higher para yield. Chlorine (3) is deactivating, so lower para yield. But if the problem assumes only para is formed, then they are all 100%. Alternatively, maybe the problem considers that even among ortho/para directors, some have higher para yields due to steric effects. For example, ethyl (5) is bulkier than methyl (1), so para is more favored. Chlorine (3) is smaller, so both ortho and para are possible, but the problem states only one product. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is not about the actual yield but the theoretical yield based on directing effects. For example, meta directors have 0% para, and ortho/para directors have 100% para. Therefore, the order is 2,4,6 < 3 <1 <5. Wait, but why would 3 (Cl) be lower than 1 and 5? If Cl is ortho/para director, then para is formed. But maybe because Cl is deactivating, the reaction is less likely to occur, but the problem states that the reaction does occur with excess bromine. Alternatively, maybe the para yield for Cl is lower than for methyl and ethyl. But again, the problem\'s condition of only one product complicates this.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that meta directors (2,4,6) have 0% para isomer, and ortho/para directors (1,3,5) have 100% para. Therefore, the order from lowest to highest para yield is:\n\n2 (COOC2H5), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH) < 3 (Cl), 1 (CH3), 5 (C2H5)\n\nBut wait, why would 3 (Cl) be after 2,4,6? Because Cl is ortho/para, so para is formed (100%), while 2,4,6 are meta directors (0%). Therefore, the order should be 2,4,6 (0%) < 1,3,5 (100%). But how to order 1,3,5 among themselves? If the problem expects that among ortho/para directors, the para yield is the same (100%), then they are equal. But the problem asks to arrange all six, so perhaps the order is:\n\n2 < 4 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5\n\nBut this would be based on some other criteria. Alternatively, maybe the para yield is not 100% for all ortho/para directors. Let\'s think differently. Maybe the para yield depends on the activating strength. For example, stronger activating groups lead to higher para yields. So:\n\n- C2H5 (5) is more activating than CH3 (1), so higher para yield.\n- Cl (3) is deactivating, so lower para yield compared to activating groups.\n\nBut in reality, even though Cl is deactivating, it\'s still an ortho/para director. However, the para yield might be lower than for activating groups. But the problem states only one product is formed, so perhaps for Cl, the para is the only product, same as for activating groups. Therefore, the order would still be 2,4,6 < 3 <1 <5. But I\'m not sure. Alternatively, maybe the order is based on the substituent\'s ability to direct para, with bulky groups favoring para more. So ethyl (5) is more bulky than methyl (1), so higher para yield. Chlorine (3) is not bulky, so lower para yield. Therefore, among ortho/para directors, the order of para yield is 3 <1 <5. Therefore, the overall order from lowest to highest para yield is:\n\n2 (COOC2H5, 0%) <4 (NO2, 0%) <6 (COOH, 0%) <3 (Cl, 100% para) <1 (CH3, 100% para) <5 (C2H5, 100% para)\n\nBut wait, all meta directors have 0%, and ortho/para have 100%, but within ortho/para, maybe the problem considers that ethyl (5) has higher para yield than methyl (1), which is higher than Cl (3). But if the problem assumes that all ortho/para directors have 100% para, then they are equal. However, the problem might expect the order based on the substituent\'s activating effect. For example, the more activating the group, the higher the para yield. Since ethyl is more activating than methyl (due to +I effect), and Cl is deactivating, the order among ortho/para directors would be Cl < methyl < ethyl. Therefore, the overall order would be:\n\n2,4,6 (0%) <3 (Cl, 100%) <1 (CH3, 100%) <5 (C2H5, 100%)\n\nBut how to order 2,4,6 among themselves? They are all meta directors with 0% para. However, perhaps the problem considers the strength of the deactivating effect. For example, stronger deactivating groups might have lower para yields, but since they are all 0%, it\'s irrelevant. Alternatively, maybe the problem orders them based on the substituent\'s priority or alphabetical order, but that\'s unlikely. The likely correct answer is that meta directors (2,4,6) have 0% para, and ortho/para directors (1,3,5) have 100% para. Therefore, the order from lowest to highest is:\n\n2 (COOC2H5), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH) <3 (Cl), 1 (CH3), 5 (C2H5)\n\nBut to arrange all six, we need to order the meta directors first, then the ortho/para. Among the meta directors, perhaps the order is based on the strength of the deactivating effect. The nitro group (4) is a stronger deactivating group than COOH (6) and COOC2H5 (2). Wait, nitro is stronger than carboxylic acid? Let\'s recall that nitro is a strong deactivating group, followed by carbonyl groups (like COOH and esters). So the order of deactivating strength might be NO2 > COOH > COOC2H5. But how does that affect para yield? Since they are all meta directors, their para yields are zero. Therefore, their order among themselves doesn\'t affect the para yield. Therefore, the problem might not require ordering them, but since the answer requires arranging all six, perhaps the order is based on the substituent\'s alphabetical order or the numbering given. But that\'s not chemistry-based. Alternatively, maybe the problem considers that among the meta directors, some might have a small amount of para isomer, but the problem states only one product. Therefore, the correct order is:\n\nIncreasing order of para yield: 2 <4 <6 <3 <1 <5\n\nBut I need to confirm. Let\'s think again:\n\nSubstituents:\n\n1) CH3: ortho/para, para formed (100%)\n2) COOC2H5: meta, para 0%\n3) Cl: ortho/para, para formed (100%)\n4) NO2: meta, para 0%\n5) C2H5: ortho/para, para formed (100%)\n6) COOH: meta, para 0%\n\nSo the para yields are:\n\n0% for 2,4,6\n\n100% for 1,3,5\n\nTherefore, the order from lowest to highest is:\n\n2,4,6 <1,3,5\n\nBut since the problem asks to arrange all six, we need to interleave them. However, since 2,4,6 are all 0%, and 1,3,5 are 100%, the order would be:\n\n2 <4 <6 <3 <1 <5\n\nBut why this order? Because within the meta directors, maybe the problem orders them as given in the list (2,4,6), and within the ortho/para directors as 3,1,5. But why? Perhaps based on the substituent\'s effect on the ring\'s reactivity. For example, among the meta directors, nitro (4) is the strongest deactivator, followed by COOH (6), then COOC2H5 (2). But I\'m not sure. Alternatively, the order in the problem\'s list is 1-6, and the answer is simply arranging them based on para yield from lowest to highest. Since 2,4,6 have 0%, and 1,3,5 have 100%, the order would be 2,4,6,1,3,5. But that doesn\'t make sense. Alternatively, the correct order is:\n\nSubstances with 0% para: 2,4,6 (order as per their given numbers: 2,4,6)\n\nSubstances with 100% para: 1,3,5 (order as per their given numbers:1,3,5)\n\nBut the problem might expect the order based on the strength of the directing effect. For example, among the ortho/para directors, the para yield might be higher for stronger activating groups. So ethyl (5) is more activating than methyl (1), which is more activating than Cl (3). Therefore, the order among ortho/para directors would be 3 <1 <5. Therefore, the overall order is:\n\n2 (0%),4 (0%),6 (0%),3 (100%),1 (100%),5 (100%)\n\nBut how to order 2,4,6? If based on deactivating strength: NO2 (4) > COOH (6) > COOC2H5 (2). So the order would be 4 <6 <2 in terms of deactivating strength, but since para yield is 0%, their order doesn\'t affect the para yield. However, the problem might list them in the order of their given numbers. But I think the intended answer is:\n\nThe order from lowest to highest para yield is: 4 (NO2), 2 (COOC2H5), 6 (COOH), 3 (Cl), 1 (CH3), 5 (C2H5)\n\nBut I\'m not entirely sure. Alternatively, the correct order is:\n\n2 <4 <6 <3 <1 <5\n\nBecause:\n\n- COOC2H5 (2) is a weaker deactivator than NO2 (4) and COOH (6), but since they are all meta directors, their para yields are 0%. Then among ortho/para directors, Cl (3) is deactivating, so lower para yield than activating groups (1 and 5), and ethyl (5) is more activating than methyl (1), leading to higher para yield. Therefore, the order is 2,4,6 (0%) <3 (Cl, 100%) <1 (CH3, 100%) <5 (C2H5, 100%). But why would Cl have lower para yield than CH3 and C2H5 if the problem states only one product is formed? If only para is formed for ortho/para directors, then all three have 100% para. Therefore, the order is 2,4,6 <1,3,5. But the problem requires arranging all six. The answer likely expects the order where meta directors come first (2,4,6) in the order of their strength as deactivators, followed by ortho/para directors in the order of their activating strength. Since NO2 is the strongest deactivator, followed by COOH, then COOC2H5, the order among meta directors would be 4 <6 <2. Then among ortho/para directors, Cl is deactivating, so lower than activating groups. So 3 <1 <5. Therefore, the overall order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5. But I\'m not sure. Another approach is to look for the para isomer yield based on the substituent\'s ability to stabilize the transition state. Stronger activating groups (like ethyl) lead to higher para yields. Deactivating ortho/para directors (Cl) have lower para yields. But if the problem assumes only para is formed for ortho/para directors, then they all have 100%. \n\nGiven the confusion, I think the intended answer is that the meta directors (2,4,6) have 0% para, and the ortho/para directors (1,3,5) have 100% para. Therefore, the order from lowest to highest is:\n\n2,4,6 <1,3,5\n\nBut since the problem asks to arrange all six substances, the order would be:\n\n2 <4 <6 <3 <1 <5\n\nThis is based on the assumption that among the meta directors, they are ordered as given (2,4,6), and among the ortho/para directors, ordered by their activating strength: Cl (3) is deactivating, so lower than methyl (1) and ethyl (5), with ethyl being the strongest activator. Therefore, the final order is 2 <4 <6 <3 <1 <5.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745447920, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=7925, prompt_tokens=590, total_tokens=8515, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the order of substances based on increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer in electrophilic bromination, we analyze the directing effects of the substituents:

1. **Meta Directors (0% para yield)**:  
   - **COOC₂H₅ (2)**, **NO₂ (4)**, and **COOH (6)** are strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) that deactivate the benzene ring and direct bromine to the **meta** position. Thus, no para-isomer is formed.  

2. **Ortho/Para Directors (100% para yield)**:  
   - **CH₃ (1)**, **Cl (3)**, and **C₂H₅ (5)** are ortho/para directors. However, steric hindrance and activation strength influence the para yield:  
     - **C₂H₅ (5)**: Bulky ethyl group strongly favors para due to steric hindrance.  
     - **CH₃ (1)**: Methyl group is less bulky than ethyl, but still activates the ring sufficiently for para dominance.  
     - **Cl (3)**: Chlorine is a deactivating ortho/para director; para is favored over ortho due to reduced steric clash.  

**Order of Increasing Para-Isomer Yield**:  
**2 (COOC₂H₅) < 4 (NO₂) < 6 (COOH) < 3 (Cl) < 1 (CH₃) < 5 (C₂H₅)**  

**Explanation**:  
- Meta directors (2, 4, 6) have 0% para yield.  
- Ortho/para directors (1, 3, 5) have 100% para yield, ordered by increasing activation strength and steric effects: Cl (weakest activator) < CH₃ < C₂H₅ (strongest activator).  

**Answer**:  
\boxed{2 < 4 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5}

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: The ethyl ester group (COOC2H5) is a strong electron-withdrawing group (EWG) due to the carbonyl. This makes the ring deactivated and meta-directing. Therefore, bromine would add in the meta position relative to the COOC2H5 group. However, if the substituent is meta-directing, then the para position relative to the substituent would not be a major product. Wait, but in meta-directing groups, the incoming electrophile attacks the meta position. So, for example, if the substituent is at position 1, the bromine would add at position 3 and 5 (if possible), but since it's a single substituent, perhaps only one position is possible. Wait, but benzene is symmetric. If the substituent is in position 1, then meta positions would be 3 and 5. However, due to the symmetry, adding bromine at 3 or 5 would be equivalent. But in the case of a single substituent, the para position (position 4) would not be meta to the substituent. Wait, perhaps I need to clarify.

Wait, when a substituent is meta-directing, the incoming electrophile attacks the meta positions relative to the substituent. For example, if the substituent is at position 1, the meta positions are 3 and 5. However, in a monosubstituted benzene, the positions are equivalent due to the ring's symmetry, so the product would be a single meta isomer. But in reality, when a substituent is meta-directing, the para position (position 4) is not a meta position. So, if the substituent is at position 1, the meta positions are 3 and 5, which are equivalent. Therefore, the product would be a single meta isomer. Therefore, in this case, the COOC2H5 group would direct bromine to the meta position, so the para isomer (relative to the substituent) would not form. Therefore, the para isomer's yield would be zero? But the question states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. So, if the substituent is meta-directing, then the product is meta, so the para isomer isn't formed. But the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. Wait, perhaps I'm confused here. Let me clarify.

Wait, the para isomer refers to the bromine being in the para position relative to the substituent. So, if the substituent is at position 1, the para position is 4. If the substituent is meta-directing, then the bromine would be at position 3 or 5 (meta to substituent), but not at position 4 (para). Therefore, the para isomer would not be formed. So, in that case, the weight fraction of the para isomer would be zero. But the question says "only one monobromo derivative is formed," which might mean that in some cases, the substituent is such that only para is possible. Wait, but for meta-directing groups, the product is meta, so the para isomer isn't formed. For ortho/para directors, the product could be ortho or para. However, in some cases, steric hindrance might prevent ortho substitution, leading to only para. For example, in toluene (methyl group), bromination gives a mixture of ortho and para, but if the substituent is bulky, maybe the para is favored. But the question states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. So perhaps in some cases, the substituent is so bulky that ortho is not possible, leading to only para. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a strong enough director that only one position is possible. For example, in nitro groups (meta director), the product is meta, so para isn't formed. For substituents that are ortho/para directors, if the substituent is bulky, like tert-butyl, then para is the major product. But in the given compounds, substituents vary. Let's list each substituent and their directing effects:

1) C6H5-CH3: Methyl group, activating, ortho/para director. Bromine can add ortho or para. However, in practice, para is favored over ortho due to less steric hindrance. But if the question states only one product is formed, perhaps in some cases, like when the substituent is very bulky, but methyl is not. So maybe in toluene, both ortho and para are possible, but the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. Wait, that's confusing. The problem says "it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed". So perhaps each of these substituents, when brominated, gives only one product. That would mean that the substituent is such that only one position is possible. For example, if the substituent is a meta director, then the bromine adds only in the meta position, leading to a single product. If the substituent is an ortho/para director but steric hindrance prevents ortho, then only para is formed. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is in a position that allows only one isomer due to symmetry. Wait, but all substituents are monosubstituted, so the ring has a single substituent. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simplifying the scenario. For example, in some cases, even if the substituent is ortho/para directing, the para isomer is the only one formed. For example, if the substituent is a strong activating group but bulky, like tert-butyl, then para is the major product. But in the given substituents, we have methyl (1), ethyl (5), which are not very bulky. COOC2H5 (2), Cl (3), NO2 (4), COOH (6). Let's analyze each:

1) Toluene (C6H5-CH3): Methyl is an activating, ortho/para director. Bromine would add ortho and para. However, if the problem states only one product is formed, perhaps in this case, the para is the only product. But in reality, toluene bromination gives a mixture. But maybe under certain conditions (like excess Br2 and a catalyst), the para is major. But the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. So perhaps for each substituent, the directing effect is such that only one position is possible. For example, if the substituent is meta-directing, then only meta is formed. If it's ortho/para, but steric hindrance makes only para possible. Let's check each substituent:

1) Methyl: ortho/para director. If the methyl is not bulky, then both ortho and para would form. But the problem says only one product. So maybe in this case, the para is the only product. But why? Maybe because the problem is simplifying, assuming that para is the major product. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's position is such that only para is possible. Wait, but in reality, toluene gives both ortho and para. The problem's statement that only one monobromo derivative is formed might be a simplification for the sake of the problem, perhaps indicating that each substituent leads to a single product, so we can ignore the actual mixture. But then, how does that affect the para isomer's yield? If the substituent is meta-directing, then the product is meta, so para yield is zero. If the substituent is ortho/para, then para is formed. But if the problem states that only one product is formed, then for ortho/para directors, perhaps only para is formed. But why? Maybe because the substituent is bulky enough to prevent ortho substitution. Let's check the substituents:

1) Methyl: not bulky, so ortho and para possible. But the problem says only one product. Hmm. Maybe the problem is assuming that for all ortho/para directors, only para is formed, and for meta directors, only meta. But that's not accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that when there's excess bromine, multiple substitutions could occur, but the question specifies monobromo. Wait, the problem says "only one monobromo derivative is formed". So each of these compounds, when brominated, gives a single monobromo product. That must be due to the directing effect leading to only one possible position. For example, if the substituent is a meta director, then the bromine adds only in the meta position, leading to a single product. If the substituent is an ortho/para director, but due to steric hindrance, only para is possible. Let's check each substituent:

1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene): Methyl is ortho/para director. If the methyl is not bulky, then both ortho and para would form. But the problem states only one product. So perhaps in this case, the para is the only product. But why? Maybe the problem is simplifying, assuming that para is the major product. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is such that the para position is the only one possible. For example, if the substituent is in a position that makes ortho impossible. But that's not the case here. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that when there's a substituent that is a strong activating group, the para is the major product. But in reality, toluene gives a mixture. However, the problem states that only one product is formed. Therefore, perhaps the assumption is that for each substituent, the directing effect is such that only one product is possible. For example:

- For meta directors (like NO2, COOH, COOC2H5, Cl?), the bromine adds in the meta position, so the para isomer (relative to the substituent) is not formed. Therefore, the yield of para isomer is zero.

Wait, but Cl is a meta director? No, wait, halogens are ortho/para directors despite being deactivating. So Cl is ortho/para director. So for substituent 3 (Cl), bromine would add ortho or para. But the problem states only one product is formed. So perhaps in this case, only para is formed. But why? Maybe because the Cl is not bulky, so both ortho and para are possible, but the problem's assumption is that only one product is formed. This is confusing. Let me list each substituent's directing effect and whether they are activating or deactivating:

1) CH3: Activating, ortho/para
2) COOC2H5: Deactivating (ester group), meta
3) Cl: Deactivating (due to electronegativity), but ortho/para director (due to resonance)
4) NO2: Deactivating, meta
5) C2H5: Activating (alkyl group), ortho/para
6) COOH: Deactivating (carboxylic acid), meta

So substituents 1,3,5 are ortho/para directors (activating or Cl), and 2,4,6 are meta directors (deactivating).

Now, the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. For meta directors (2,4,6), the bromine would add in the meta position relative to the substituent. Since the substituent is at position 1, the meta positions are 3 and 5. However, due to the ring's symmetry, adding bromine at 3 or 5 would result in the same product. Therefore, even though there are two possible positions, the product is considered a single isomer because they are equivalent. So for meta directors, the product is the meta isomer, and the para isomer (position 4) is not formed, so its yield is zero.

For ortho/para directors (1,3,5), bromine can add ortho (position 2) or para (position 4) relative to the substituent. However, the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. This suggests that in these cases, either ortho or para is formed exclusively. For example, if the substituent is bulky, para is favored. Let's check the substituents:

1) CH3: Methyl is a small group, so both ortho and para are possible, but maybe under certain conditions, para is major. However, the problem states only one product, so perhaps para is the only product. But in reality, toluene bromination gives a mixture. The problem's assumption might be that para is the only product for ortho/para directors. Alternatively, maybe steric hindrance is considered. For example, in toluene, the para position is less hindered, so only para forms. But methyl is not that bulky. However, if the problem states that only one product is formed, we have to go with that.

3) Cl: Chlorine is an ortho/para director. Chlorine is more electronegative, but still directs ortho/para. However, due to its size, maybe para is favored. But again, in reality, both ortho and para are possible. But the problem says only one product. So perhaps para is formed.

5) C2H5: Ethyl group is larger than methyl. So maybe in this case, the ethyl group is bulky enough to hinder ortho substitution, leading to only para product. So for substituent 5, para is formed.

Therefore, for substituents 1,3,5 (ortho/para directors), the para isomer is formed, and for substituents 2,4,6 (meta directors), the meta isomer is formed, so the para isomer's yield is zero.

But the question asks to arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. So the para yield would be zero for 2,4,6, and some positive value for 1,3,5. But wait, if for 1,3,5, the para is the only product, then their para yield is 100%. But the problem says "weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer". So the para yield would be 100% for 1,3,5 and 0% for 2,4,6. Therefore, the order from lowest to highest para yield would be 2,4,6 (0%) followed by 1,3,5 (100%). But the problem says "increasing order of weight fraction of the para-isomer", so the order would be 2,4,6 first (all 0%), then 1,3,5 (100%). But how to differentiate between 1,3,5? Are their para yields all 100%? But maybe there's a mistake here. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is more nuanced. For example, even among ortho/para directors, the ratio of para to ortho can vary. For example, toluene (methyl) gives more para than ortho, but not 100%. Similarly, ethyl group (substituent 5) might have more para due to steric hindrance. Chlorine (substituent 3) might have a different ratio. However, the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed, implying that for each substituent, only one product is possible. Therefore, perhaps for substituents 1,3,5, the para isomer is the only product (100% yield), and for 2,4,6, the para isomer is 0%. Therefore, all meta directors have 0% para, and ortho/para directors have 100% para. In that case, the order from lowest to highest would be 2,4,6 (0%) followed by 1,3,5 (100%). But the problem asks to arrange all six substances in order of increasing para yield. So the order would be 2,4,6 < 1,3,5. But how to order 2,4,6 among themselves? They all have 0% para. Similarly, 1,3,5 all have 100% para. But maybe there's a mistake in the problem's assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the para yield is not exactly 100% or 0%, but varies based on the substituent's directing strength. For example, some meta directors might allow a small amount of para isomer, but the problem states only one product is formed. Therefore, the initial assumption is that for meta directors, para is 0%, and for ortho/para directors, para is 100%. Therefore, the order would be 2,4,6 (0%) < 1,3,5 (100%). But since the problem lists six substances, we need to arrange all six. However, if all meta directors have 0% and all ortho/para have 100%, then the order is 2,4,6 < 1,3,5. But the problem might expect a more detailed order. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that even among ortho/para directors, the para yield varies. For example, stronger activating groups might have higher para yields. Let's think:

Substituents 1 (CH3), 3 (Cl), 5 (C2H5) are ortho/para directors. Among these, Cl is deactivating but ortho/para. The activating groups (CH3, C2H5) are stronger directors. Maybe the para yield is higher for stronger activating groups. However, Cl, being deactivating, might have a lower para yield. Wait, but the problem states that only one product is formed. So if the substituent is Cl, and it's ortho/para director, but the problem says only one product, then perhaps for Cl, the para is formed. But in reality, Cl can direct both ortho and para. However, the problem's condition might override this, leading to only para. Alternatively, maybe the para yield is higher for more activating groups. For example, methyl and ethyl are stronger activating than Cl, so their para yields are higher. But if the problem states only one product, then all three (1,3,5) have 100% para. But perhaps the problem is not considering that, and instead, the actual para yields vary. Let's think without the problem's condition for a moment.

In reality:

- Toluene (CH3): ortho and para, with para being major (like 60-70% para, 30-40% ortho).
- Chlorobenzene (Cl): ortho and para, but due to deactivation, the reaction is slower. The para might be slightly favored over ortho, but both are formed.
- Ethylbenzene (C2H5): similar to toluene, but ethyl is slightly bulkier, so para might be more favored (higher para % than toluene).

But the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. So perhaps in this hypothetical scenario, for substituents that are ortho/para directors, only para is formed (due to steric hindrance preventing ortho), and for meta directors, only meta. Therefore, the para yield would be 100% for 1,3,5 and 0% for 2,4,6. Hence, the order from lowest to highest para yield would be 2,4,6 < 1,3,5. But since the problem lists six substances, and 2,4,6 are all 0%, and 1,3,5 are 100%, how to order them? The problem might expect the order based on the substituent's ability to direct para, but if they are all 100%, they are equal. However, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the para yield is not 100% for all ortho/para directors. Let's consider that even among ortho/para directors, the para yield varies. For example:

- For substituent 5 (C2H5), ethyl is bulkier than methyl (1), so para is more favored (higher yield).
- For substituent 1 (CH3), para is less favored than 5 but more than 3.
- For substituent 3 (Cl), being a deactivating group, the para yield might be lower than activating groups. Wait, but Cl is ortho/para director. However, because it's deactivating, the reaction is slower, but the directing is still ortho/para. In terms of yield, if the reaction is slower, but the para is still formed, but maybe the ratio of para to ortho is different. However, the problem states only one product is formed, so perhaps in this case, para is the only product. But I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, maybe the para yield is determined by the substituent's ability to stabilize the transition state. Stronger activating groups (like methyl, ethyl) better stabilize the transition state for para substitution, leading to higher para yields. Chlorine, being deactivating, might lead to lower para yield compared to methyl and ethyl. But again, the problem's condition of only one product complicates this.

Wait, perhaps the key is that for substituents that are meta directors, the para isomer is not formed (0% yield), and for ortho/para directors, the para isomer is formed (100% yield). Therefore, the order would be:

Lowest para yield: 2 (COOC2H5), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH) (all 0%)

Then higher para yield: 1 (CH3), 3 (Cl), 5 (C2H5) (all 100%)

But since the problem asks to arrange all six in order, we need to sort the three meta directors and the three ortho/para directors. Among the meta directors (2,4,6), perhaps their para yields are all 0%, so they are equal. Similarly, among the ortho/para directors (1,3,5), their para yields are all 100%. But the problem might expect a specific order based on the substituent's effects. For example, maybe among the ortho/para directors, the para yield is higher for more activating groups. So ethyl (5) is more activating than methyl (1), so higher para yield. Chlorine (3) is deactivating, so lower para yield. But if the problem assumes only para is formed, then they are all 100%. Alternatively, maybe the problem considers that even among ortho/para directors, some have higher para yields due to steric effects. For example, ethyl (5) is bulkier than methyl (1), so para is more favored. Chlorine (3) is smaller, so both ortho and para are possible, but the problem states only one product. This is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about the actual yield but the theoretical yield based on directing effects. For example, meta directors have 0% para, and ortho/para directors have 100% para. Therefore, the order is 2,4,6 < 3 <1 <5. Wait, but why would 3 (Cl) be lower than 1 and 5? If Cl is ortho/para director, then para is formed. But maybe because Cl is deactivating, the reaction is less likely to occur, but the problem states that the reaction does occur with excess bromine. Alternatively, maybe the para yield for Cl is lower than for methyl and ethyl. But again, the problem's condition of only one product complicates this.

Given the confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that meta directors (2,4,6) have 0% para isomer, and ortho/para directors (1,3,5) have 100% para. Therefore, the order from lowest to highest para yield is:

2 (COOC2H5), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH) < 3 (Cl), 1 (CH3), 5 (C2H5)

But wait, why would 3 (Cl) be after 2,4,6? Because Cl is ortho/para, so para is formed (100%), while 2,4,6 are meta directors (0%). Therefore, the order should be 2,4,6 (0%) < 1,3,5 (100%). But how to order 1,3,5 among themselves? If the problem expects that among ortho/para directors, the para yield is the same (100%), then they are equal. But the problem asks to arrange all six, so perhaps the order is:

2 < 4 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5

But this would be based on some other criteria. Alternatively, maybe the para yield is not 100% for all ortho/para directors. Let's think differently. Maybe the para yield depends on the activating strength. For example, stronger activating groups lead to higher para yields. So:

- C2H5 (5) is more activating than CH3 (1), so higher para yield.
- Cl (3) is deactivating, so lower para yield compared to activating groups.

But in reality, even though Cl is deactivating, it's still an ortho/para director. However, the para yield might be lower than for activating groups. But the problem states only one product is formed, so perhaps for Cl, the para is the only product, same as for activating groups. Therefore, the order would still be 2,4,6 < 3 <1 <5. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the order is based on the substituent's ability to direct para, with bulky groups favoring para more. So ethyl (5) is more bulky than methyl (1), so higher para yield. Chlorine (3) is not bulky, so lower para yield. Therefore, among ortho/para directors, the order of para yield is 3 <1 <5. Therefore, the overall order from lowest to highest para yield is:

2 (COOC2H5, 0%) <4 (NO2, 0%) <6 (COOH, 0%) <3 (Cl, 100% para) <1 (CH3, 100% para) <5 (C2H5, 100% para)

But wait, all meta directors have 0%, and ortho/para have 100%, but within ortho/para, maybe the problem considers that ethyl (5) has higher para yield than methyl (1), which is higher than Cl (3). But if the problem assumes that all ortho/para directors have 100% para, then they are equal. However, the problem might expect the order based on the substituent's activating effect. For example, the more activating the group, the higher the para yield. Since ethyl is more activating than methyl (due to +I effect), and Cl is deactivating, the order among ortho/para directors would be Cl < methyl < ethyl. Therefore, the overall order would be:

2,4,6 (0%) <3 (Cl, 100%) <1 (CH3, 100%) <5 (C2H5, 100%)

But how to order 2,4,6 among themselves? They are all meta directors with 0% para. However, perhaps the problem considers the strength of the deactivating effect. For example, stronger deactivating groups might have lower para yields, but since they are all 0%, it's irrelevant. Alternatively, maybe the problem orders them based on the substituent's priority or alphabetical order, but that's unlikely. The likely correct answer is that meta directors (2,4,6) have 0% para, and ortho/para directors (1,3,5) have 100% para. Therefore, the order from lowest to highest is:

2 (COOC2H5), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH) <3 (Cl), 1 (CH3), 5 (C2H5)

But to arrange all six, we need to order the meta directors first, then the ortho/para. Among the meta directors, perhaps the order is based on the strength of the deactivating effect. The nitro group (4) is a stronger deactivating group than COOH (6) and COOC2H5 (2). Wait, nitro is stronger than carboxylic acid? Let's recall that nitro is a strong deactivating group, followed by carbonyl groups (like COOH and esters). So the order of deactivating strength might be NO2 > COOH > COOC2H5. But how does that affect para yield? Since they are all meta directors, their para yields are zero. Therefore, their order among themselves doesn't affect the para yield. Therefore, the problem might not require ordering them, but since the answer requires arranging all six, perhaps the order is based on the substituent's alphabetical order or the numbering given. But that's not chemistry-based. Alternatively, maybe the problem considers that among the meta directors, some might have a small amount of para isomer, but the problem states only one product. Therefore, the correct order is:

Increasing order of para yield: 2 <4 <6 <3 <1 <5

But I need to confirm. Let's think again:

Substituents:

1) CH3: ortho/para, para formed (100%)
2) COOC2H5: meta, para 0%
3) Cl: ortho/para, para formed (100%)
4) NO2: meta, para 0%
5) C2H5: ortho/para, para formed (100%)
6) COOH: meta, para 0%

So the para yields are:

0% for 2,4,6

100% for 1,3,5

Therefore, the order from lowest to highest is:

2,4,6 <1,3,5

But since the problem asks to arrange all six, we need to interleave them. However, since 2,4,6 are all 0%, and 1,3,5 are 100%, the order would be:

2 <4 <6 <3 <1 <5

But why this order? Because within the meta directors, maybe the problem orders them as given in the list (2,4,6), and within the ortho/para directors as 3,1,5. But why? Perhaps based on the substituent's effect on the ring's reactivity. For example, among the meta directors, nitro (4) is the strongest deactivator, followed by COOH (6), then COOC2H5 (2). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the order in the problem's list is 1-6, and the answer is simply arranging them based on para yield from lowest to highest. Since 2,4,6 have 0%, and 1,3,5 have 100%, the order would be 2,4,6,1,3,5. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the correct order is:

Substances with 0% para: 2,4,6 (order as per their given numbers: 2,4,6)

Substances with 100% para: 1,3,5 (order as per their given numbers:1,3,5)

But the problem might expect the order based on the strength of the directing effect. For example, among the ortho/para directors, the para yield might be higher for stronger activating groups. So ethyl (5) is more activating than methyl (1), which is more activating than Cl (3). Therefore, the order among ortho/para directors would be 3 <1 <5. Therefore, the overall order is:

2 (0%),4 (0%),6 (0%),3 (100%),1 (100%),5 (100%)

But how to order 2,4,6? If based on deactivating strength: NO2 (4) > COOH (6) > COOC2H5 (2). So the order would be 4 <6 <2 in terms of deactivating strength, but since para yield is 0%, their order doesn't affect the para yield. However, the problem might list them in the order of their given numbers. But I think the intended answer is:

The order from lowest to highest para yield is: 4 (NO2), 2 (COOC2H5), 6 (COOH), 3 (Cl), 1 (CH3), 5 (C2H5)

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the correct order is:

2 <4 <6 <3 <1 <5

Because:

- COOC2H5 (2) is a weaker deactivator than NO2 (4) and COOH (6), but since they are all meta directors, their para yields are 0%. Then among ortho/para directors, Cl (3) is deactivating, so lower para yield than activating groups (1 and 5), and ethyl (5) is more activating than methyl (1), leading to higher para yield. Therefore, the order is 2,4,6 (0%) <3 (Cl, 100%) <1 (CH3, 100%) <5 (C2H5, 100%). But why would Cl have lower para yield than CH3 and C2H5 if the problem states only one product is formed? If only para is formed for ortho/para directors, then all three have 100% para. Therefore, the order is 2,4,6 <1,3,5. But the problem requires arranging all six. The answer likely expects the order where meta directors come first (2,4,6) in the order of their strength as deactivators, followed by ortho/para directors in the order of their activating strength. Since NO2 is the strongest deactivator, followed by COOH, then COOC2H5, the order among meta directors would be 4 <6 <2. Then among ortho/para directors, Cl is deactivating, so lower than activating groups. So 3 <1 <5. Therefore, the overall order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5. But I'm not sure. Another approach is to look for the para isomer yield based on the substituent's ability to stabilize the transition state. Stronger activating groups (like ethyl) lead to higher para yields. Deactivating ortho/para directors (Cl) have lower para yields. But if the problem assumes only para is formed for ortho/para directors, then they all have 100%. 

Given the confusion, I think the intended answer is that the meta directors (2,4,6) have 0% para, and the ortho/para directors (1,3,5) have 100% para. Therefore, the order from lowest to highest is:

2,4,6 <1,3,5

But since the problem asks to arrange all six substances, the order would be:

2 <4 <6 <3 <1 <5

This is based on the assumption that among the meta directors, they are ordered as given (2,4,6), and among the ortho/para directors, ordered by their activating strength: Cl (3) is deactivating, so lower than methyl (1) and ethyl (5), with ethyl being the strongest activator. Therefore, the final order is 2 <4 <6 <3 <1 <5.
