To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we need to consider the quantized energy levels and the Pauli exclusion principle. The energy levels for a single particle are given by \( E_n = n^2E \), where \( E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2} \). Each energy level \( n \) can hold up to two particles.

1. **Ground State**:
   - The lowest energy configuration is achieved by filling the lowest energy levels first.
   - Two particles in \( n=1 \) and two particles in \( n=2 \).
   - Total energy: \( 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2(1^2E) + 2(2^2E) = 2E + 8E = 10E \).

2. **First Excited State**:
   - The next lowest energy configuration is obtained by promoting one particle from the highest occupied level \( n=2 \) to the next available level \( n=3 \).
   - Two particles in \( n=1 \), one particle in \( n=2 \), and one particle in \( n=3 \).
   - Total energy: \( 2E_1 + 1E_2 + 1E_3 = 2(1^2E) + 1(2^2E) + 1(3^2E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E \).

3. **Second Excited State**:
   - The next configuration is obtained by promoting one particle from \( n=1 \) to \( n=3 \), leaving one particle in \( n=1 \), two particles in \( n=2 \), and one particle in \( n=3 \).
   - Total energy: \( 1E_1 + 2E_2 + 1E_3 = 1(1^2E) + 2(2^2E) + 1(3^2E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E \).

Thus, the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are:

\[
\boxed{10E}, \quad \boxed{15E}, \quad \boxed{18E}
\]

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I have this problem here where four identical spin-1/2 particles are placed in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state in terms of E, which is given as π²ℏ²/(2mL²). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the energy levels for a single particle are quantized. The energy levels are given by E_n = n²E, where n is a positive integer (1, 2, 3, ...) and E is the base energy unit defined here. So each energy level corresponds to a different quantum number n.

But since we're dealing with identical spin-1/2 particles, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means each quantum state can be occupied by at most two particles, one with spin up and one with spin down. So, for each energy level (n), there are two possible states. Therefore, when filling up the energy levels, each n can hold up to two electrons—err, particles, in this case.

Wait, the problem says spin-1/2 particles, so electrons or fermions in general. So, yes, Pauli exclusion applies. So, the way to determine the ground state is to fill the lowest energy levels first, putting two particles in each level until all four are placed.

Let me start with the ground state. For the ground state, we want the lowest total energy. So, we fill the lowest possible energy levels with the particles. Since each energy level can hold two particles, the first two particles will go into the n=1 level. Then the next two particles will go into the n=2 level. So, the ground state configuration would have two particles in n=1 and two particles in n=2. Therefore, the total energy would be 2*E_1 + 2*E_2. Since E_n = n²E, that would be 2*(1²)E + 2*(2²)E = 2E + 8E = 10E. Wait, is that right? Let me check again. Each particle in n=1 has energy E, so two particles contribute 2E. Each particle in n=2 has energy 4E, so two particles contribute 8E. Total is 10E. That seems correct for the ground state.

Now, the first excited state. The first excited state is the next lowest energy state after the ground state. For fermions, the excited states are obtained by promoting one or more particles to higher energy levels. But we have to make sure we're not violating the Pauli exclusion principle. So, how do we get the first excited state here?

In the ground state, we have filled n=1 and n=2 each with two particles. The next available energy level is n=3. To get the first excited state, we need to promote one particle from the highest filled level (n=2) to the next available level (n=3). But wait, how does that work? Let me think.

If we have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. If we promote one particle from n=2 to n=3, then we would have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. But since each energy level can hold two particles, having one in n=2 and one in n=3 is allowed. But is this the first excited state?

Alternatively, maybe promoting two particles? But promoting two particles would require more energy. So, promoting one particle would result in a lower total energy increase. Let's calculate the energy in both cases.

Original ground state energy: 2E + 8E = 10E.

If we promote one particle from n=2 to n=3: Then we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. The energy would be 2E + 1*(4E) + 1*(9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E. Wait, but that's higher than the ground state. Wait, but the ground state is 10E. So 15E is higher. But is this the first excited state?

Wait, maybe there's another configuration. Let me think. If instead of filling n=1 and n=2 completely, maybe there's a different way to arrange the particles with higher energy but still lower than 15E. But according to the Pauli exclusion principle, we have to fill the lowest energy levels first. So, the ground state is the one with the lowest possible energy, which is two in n=1 and two in n=2. Then, the first excited state would be when we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. But that gives a total energy of 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E. But wait, is there a configuration with a lower energy than 15E but higher than 10E?

Alternatively, maybe promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3? But n=1 is already filled with two particles. To promote a particle from n=1 to n=3, we would have to leave one in n=1, which is allowed? Wait, no. If we have two particles in n=1, we can't just take one out and put it in n=3 because we can't have three particles in n=1. Wait, no. If you promote one particle from n=1 to n=3, you would have one particle left in n=1 and one in n=3. But n=1 can only hold two particles. Wait, no. If you have two particles in n=1, you can't just remove one. The Pauli exclusion principle says that each state can have at most two particles. So, if you have two in n=1, you can't have three. But if you promote one from n=1 to n=3, you would have one in n=1 and one in n=3. But that would leave n=1 with one particle, which is allowed. Wait, but the total number of particles is four. Let me check.

Original: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2. Total 4.

If we promote one from n=2 to n=3: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Total 4. Energy: 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.

If we promote one from n=1 to n=3: 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Total 4. Energy: 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. That's higher. So promoting from n=1 gives higher energy. Therefore, the first excited state is 15E.

Wait, but is there another configuration where we have three particles in a higher energy level? For example, two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. That's the same as before. Or maybe two in n=1, and two in n=3? But that would require promoting two particles from n=2 to n=3. Let's see: 2E + 0 + 2*9E = 2E + 18E = 20E. That's even higher. So 15E is lower. So 15E is the first excited state.

Wait, but maybe there's another way. Let me think. If we have three particles in n=2 and one in n=3. But n=2 can only hold two particles. So, three particles in n=2 would violate the Pauli exclusion principle. So that's not allowed. Similarly, n=1 can only hold two. So, the possible configurations are limited by the number of particles per energy level.

Therefore, the first excited state must be 15E. Then, the second excited state would be the next one. Let's see. After 15E, what's the next possible configuration?

If we promote another particle from n=2 to n=3, we would have two in n=1, zero in n=2, and two in n=3. Wait, but that would require promoting two particles from n=2 to n=3. Let's calculate the energy: 2E + 0 + 2*9E = 2E + 18E = 20E. Alternatively, maybe promoting one particle from n=2 to n=4? Let's see. If we have two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4. Then the energy is 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E. That's higher than 20E. Alternatively, promoting one from n=1 to n=2. Wait, but n=1 is already filled with two particles. If we promote one from n=1 to n=2, we would have one in n=1, three in n=2. But n=2 can only hold two particles. So that's not allowed. So that's invalid.

Alternatively, promoting one from n=1 to n=3 and one from n=2 to n=3. Let's see. If we promote one from n=1 to n=3 and one from n=2 to n=3, then we have one in n=1, one in n=2, and two in n=3. Total energy: 1E + 4E + 2*9E = 1E + 4E + 18E = 23E. That's even higher.

Alternatively, maybe promoting two particles from n=2 to n=3. So, two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3. Energy: 2E + 0 + 18E = 20E. So that's 20E. Alternatively, promoting one from n=2 to n=4. So, two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4. Energy: 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E. So 20E is lower. So 20E would be the next excited state. But is there a configuration between 15E and 20E?

Wait, let's think again. The first excited state is 15E. Then, the next one could be if we have two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Then, if we promote another particle from n=2 to n=3, we get two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3. That's 20E. But is there a way to have another configuration with energy between 15E and 20E?

Alternatively, maybe promoting one particle from n=1 to n=2. Wait, but n=1 has two particles. If we promote one to n=2, then n=1 would have one, and n=2 would have three. But n=2 can only have two. So that's not allowed. So that's invalid.

Alternatively, promoting one from n=1 to n=4. Then, we have one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=4. Energy: 1E + 8E + 16E = 25E. That's higher. So no.

Alternatively, maybe having two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. Wait, that's 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E. Still higher than 20E.

Hmm. So between 15E and 20E, is there any possible configuration? Let's see. Let's list all possible configurations with four particles:

1. All four in n=1: Not allowed, since only two can be there.

2. Two in n=1, two in n=2: Ground state, 10E.

3. Two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3: 15E.

4. Two in n=1, two in n=3: 20E.

5. One in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3: 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. Wait, this is another configuration. How is this possible?

Wait, if we have one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. But n=2 can only hold two particles. So that's allowed. How do we get this configuration? Is this a valid excited state?

To get this, we would have to promote one particle from n=1 to n=3, leaving one in n=1, and keeping two in n=2. So, the energy would be 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. So, this is a possible configuration. But why didn't I consider this before?

Wait, in the ground state, we have two in n=1 and two in n=2. To get to this new configuration (1 in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3), we need to promote one particle from n=1 to n=3. But promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3 requires more energy than promoting from n=2 to n=3. Because the energy difference between n=1 and n=3 is 9E - 1E = 8E, whereas promoting from n=2 to n=3 is 9E - 4E = 5E. So, promoting from n=2 to n=3 is a smaller energy jump. Therefore, the configuration with one promoted from n=2 to n=3 (15E) is lower in energy than promoting from n=1 to n=3 (18E). Therefore, 15E is the first excited state, and 18E would be a higher excited state.

But then, is 18E the second excited state? Let's see. After 15E, the next possible is 18E, then 20E. But wait, 18E comes from a different configuration. So, the order of energies would be 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), 18E (second excited), 20E (third), etc. But the problem asks for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. So, maybe the second excited state is 18E. But I need to confirm.

Wait, let's think about the possible configurations and their energies:

- Ground state: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2: 2E + 8E = 10E.

- First excited: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3: 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.

- Next, promoting another particle from n=2 to n=3: 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3: 2E + 0 + 18E = 20E.

Alternatively, promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3: 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3: 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.

So, which one is lower in energy between 18E and 20E? 18E is lower. So, the order would be 10E, 15E, 18E, 20E, etc. Therefore, the second excited state would be 18E.

But wait, how does the promotion work? To get from the ground state (10E) to 15E, we promote one from n=2 to n=3. To get to 18E, we need to promote one from n=1 to n=3. But is there a way to get 18E without going through 15E? Or is 18E considered a separate excited state?

In other words, the excited states are determined by the total energy, regardless of the promotion path. So, the states are ordered by their total energy. So, 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), 18E (second excited), 20E (third excited), etc.

But let's verify if 18E is indeed the next one after 15E. Let's list all possible configurations:

1. 2,2,0,0,...: 10E

2. 2,1,1,0,...: 15E

3. 1,2,1,0,...: 18E

4. 2,0,2,0,...: 20E

5. 1,1,2,0,...: 1E + 4E + 18E = 23E

6. 0,2,2,0,...: 0 + 8E + 18E = 26E

7. 2,1,0,1,...: 2E + 4E + 0 + 16E = 22E

Wait, but some of these might not be possible. For example, configuration 3: 1,2,1,0. That is, one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3. Is that allowed? Yes, because each energy level n=1, n=2, n=3 can hold up to two particles. So, n=1 has one, n=2 has two, n=3 has one. That's allowed. Similarly, configuration 4: two in n=1, none in n=2, two in n=3. Allowed.

So, ordering by energy:

10E (ground)

15E (first excited)

18E (second excited)

20E (third excited)

22E (fourth excited)

23E, etc.

Therefore, the second excited state is 18E. But wait, is there another configuration with energy between 15E and 18E?

Let me check. For example, promoting one particle from n=2 to n=4. So, two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4. Energy: 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E. That's higher than 18E.

Alternatively, promoting one from n=1 to n=2. But n=2 is already filled with two particles. If we promote one from n=1 to n=2, we would have one in n=1 and three in n=2, which is not allowed. So that's invalid.

Alternatively, promoting one from n=1 to n=3 and one from n=2 to n=3. That would give one in n=1, one in n=2, two in n=3. Energy: 1E + 4E + 18E = 23E. Still higher.

So, no, there's no configuration between 15E and 18E. Therefore, the order is 10E, 15E, 18E, 20E, etc. So, the second excited state is 18E.

But wait, another thought: when you have degenerate energy levels, maybe there are different configurations with the same energy. But in this case, the energy levels are non-degenerate except for the spin. Each n has a distinct energy. So, each configuration corresponds to a unique energy. Therefore, the energies are 10E, 15E, 18E, 20E, etc.

Therefore, the answer should be:

Ground state: 10E

First excited state: 15E

Second excited state: 18E

But let me double-check. Let's think about the possible ways to distribute the four particles.

Another approach: the total energy is the sum of the individual energies. To minimize the total energy, we fill the lowest levels first. For four particles, with two per level, we fill n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles). Total energy 2*1²E + 2*2²E = 2E + 8E = 10E. That's the ground state.

For the first excited state, we need the next lowest energy configuration. The next possible configuration is obtained by promoting one particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the next available level (n=3). So, two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. Total energy 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E. That's the first excited state.

For the second excited state, the next configuration could be either promoting another particle from n=2 to n=3 (resulting in two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3, total energy 2E + 0 + 18E = 20E) or promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3 (resulting in one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3, total energy 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E). Since 18E is lower than 20E, the second excited state is 18E.

Therefore, the energies are:

Ground state: 10E

First excited state: 15E

Second excited state: 18E

Yes, that seems correct. Let me confirm once more.

Another way to think about it: the possible configurations and their energies:

1. (2,2,0): 10E

2. (2,1,1): 15E

3. (1,2,1): 18E

4. (2,0,2): 20E

So, ordered by energy: 10E, 15E, 18E, 20E. Therefore, the second excited state is 18E.

Therefore, the answer should be:

Ground state: 10E

First excited state: 15E

Second excited state: 18E

I think that's correct. Let me check if there's any other possible configuration I might have missed. For example, could we have particles in higher energy levels like n=4 in the second excited state? For example, (2,1,0,1): two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4. Energy: 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E. That's higher than 18E, so it's a higher excited state. So no, 18E is indeed the second excited state.

Therefore, the final answers are:

Ground state: 10E

First excited state: 15E

Second excited state: 18E

**Final Answer**
The ground state energy is \boxed{10E}, the first excited state energy is \boxed{15E}, and the second excited state energy is \boxed{18E}.

Okay, so I have this problem here where four identical spin-1/2 particles are placed in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state in terms of E, which is given as π²ℏ²/(2mL²). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the energy levels for a single particle are quantized. The energy levels are given by E_n = n²E, where n is a positive integer (1, 2, 3, ...) and E is the base energy unit defined here. So each energy level corresponds to a different quantum number n.

But since we're dealing with identical spin-1/2 particles, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means each quantum state can be occupied by at most two particles, one with spin up and one with spin down. So, for each energy level (n), there are two possible states. Therefore, when filling up the energy levels, each n can hold up to two electrons—err, particles, in this case.

Wait, the problem says spin-1/2 particles, so electrons or fermions in general. So, yes, Pauli exclusion applies. So, the way to determine the ground state is to fill the lowest energy levels first, putting two particles in each level until all four are placed.

Let me start with the ground state. For the ground state, we want the lowest total energy. So, we fill the lowest possible energy levels with the particles. Since each energy level can hold two particles, the first two particles will go into the n=1 level. Then the next two particles will go into the n=2 level. So, the ground state configuration would have two particles in n=1 and two particles in n=2. Therefore, the total energy would be 2*E_1 + 2*E_2. Since E_n = n²E, that would be 2*(1²)E + 2*(2²)E = 2E + 8E = 10E. Wait, is that right? Let me check again. Each particle in n=1 has energy E, so two particles contribute 2E. Each particle in n=2 has energy 4E, so two particles contribute 8E. Total is 10E. That seems correct for the ground state.

Now, the first excited state. The first excited state is the next lowest energy state after the ground state. For fermions, the excited states are obtained by promoting one or more particles to higher energy levels. But we have to make sure we're not violating the Pauli exclusion principle. So, how do we get the first excited state here?

In the ground state, we have filled n=1 and n=2 each with two particles. The next available energy level is n=3. To get the first excited state, we need to promote one particle from the highest filled level (n=2) to the next available level (n=3). But wait, how does that work? Let me think.

If we have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. If we promote one particle from n=2 to n=3, then we would have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. But since each energy level can hold two particles, having one in n=2 and one in n=3 is allowed. But is this the first excited state?

Alternatively, maybe promoting two particles? But promoting two particles would require more energy. So, promoting one particle would result in a lower total energy increase. Let's calculate the energy in both cases.

Original ground state energy: 2E + 8E = 10E.

If we promote one particle from n=2 to n=3: Then we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. The energy would be 2E + 1*(4E) + 1*(9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E. Wait, but that's higher than the ground state. Wait, but the ground state is 10E. So 15E is higher. But is this the first excited state?

Wait, maybe there's another configuration. Let me think. If instead of filling n=1 and n=2 completely, maybe there's a different way to arrange the particles with higher energy but still lower than 15E. But according to the Pauli exclusion principle, we have to fill the lowest energy levels first. So, the ground state is the one with the lowest possible energy, which is two in n=1 and two in n=2.

Alright, I'm considering a problem where four identical spin-1/2 particles are contained in a one-dimensional infinite potential well with length L. I need to determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state in terms of E, which is defined as π²ℏ²/(2mL²).

For a single particle in such a well, the energy levels are quantized as E_n = n²E, where n is a positive integer (1, 2, 3, etc.) and E is our base energy unit. However, since we're dealing with multiple identical spin-1/2 particles, I must account for the Pauli exclusion principle. This fundamental principle states that each quantum state can accommodate at most two particles - one with spin up and one with spin down.

For the ground state configuration, I need to arrange the four particles to minimize total energy. Since each energy level n can hold up to two particles, I'll place two particles in the n=1 level and two particles in the n=2 level. The energy calculation is therefore: 2*(1²)E + 2*(2²)E = 2E + 8E = 10E. I can verify this by noting that each particle in the n=1 level contributes E energy, so two particles contribute 2E. Similarly, each particle in the n=2 level contributes 4E, so two particles contribute 8E, giving a total of 10E.

For the first excited state, I need to find the next lowest energy configuration after the ground state. This involves promoting particles to higher energy levels while continuing to obey the Pauli exclusion principle. In the ground state, I have fully occupied the n=1 and n=2 levels with two particles each. The next available level is n=3.

If I promote one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level, I would have two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. The energy of this configuration would be: 2*(1²)E + 1*(2²)E + 1*(3²)E = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E. This represents an increase from the ground state energy of 10E.

I should consider whether there might be another configuration with energy between 10E and 15E, but based on the Pauli exclusion principle, we must fill the lowest energy levels first, so the ground state is indeed the lowest possible energy configuration with two particles in n=1 and two in n=2.

Alright, here's how I'm tackling this situation: we have four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The task is to determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state in terms of E, where E is defined as π²ℏ²/(2mL²). Let's break this down.

Firstly, in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, individual particle energy levels are quantized. These levels are determined by E_n = n²E, where n is a positive integer (1, 2, 3, ...) and E is the base unit of energy defined here. Thus, each energy level corresponds to a specific quantum number n.

Now, considering these are identical spin-1/2 particles, the Pauli exclusion principle comes into play: each quantum state can be occupied by at most two particles, one with spin up and one with spin down. So, for each energy level n, there are two possible states available. Hence, for our four particles, each n can accommodate up to two particles.

Acknowledging the particles are spin-1/2, they are fermions, hence subject to the Pauli exclusion principle. To determine the ground state, we populate the lowest energy levels first, fitting two particles in each level until all four particles are accounted for.

Let's explore the ground state. Seeking the lowest total energy, we put the first two particles in the n=1 level, and the next two in the n=2 level. Therefore, the ground-state configuration has two particles in n=1 and two in n=2, resulting in a total energy of 2*E_1 + 2*E_2. With E_n = n²E, this equates to 2*(1²)E + 2*(2²)E = 2E + 8E = 10E. Verifying, each n=1 particle carries energy E, contributing 2E; each n=2 particle holds energy 4E, contributing 8E, summing to 10E total. This appears consistent for the ground state.

Next, the first excited state is the lowest energy state following the ground state. For fermions, this involves elevating one or more particles to higher energy levels without breaching the Pauli exclusion principle. So, what constitutes the first excited state here?

In the ground state, the n=1 and n=2 levels are fully occupied. The next energy level is n=3. To reach the first excited state, a particle from the highest filled level (n=2) is elevated to n=3. How does that configure our particles?

Currently, we have two in n=1, two in n=2. Elevating one from n=2 to n=3 results in two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. This configuration respects the two-particles-per-level rule. But is this the first excited state?

Contemplating promoting two particles incurs higher energy, so raising one should provide the least energy increase. Calculating:

Initial ground state energy: 2E + 8E = 10E.

Upon raising one from n=2 to n=3: two particles in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. This would give an energy of 2E + 1*(4E) + 1*(9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E. Confirming, ground state is 10E, making 15E higher indeed. This seems to be the first excited state.

Considering alternate configurations: rearranging for lesser energy while respecting the Pauli principle leads us back to filling lowest levels first, affirming ground state as two in n=1, two in n=2.

But is there a state with a lower energy than 15E?\n\nWait, perhaps if we have three particles in n=1 and one in n=2? But wait, n=1 can only hold two particles. So, we can't have three in n=1. Similarly, n=2 can hold two. So, the maximum in n=1 is two, and the rest have to go to higher levels. So, if we have four particles, the minimum energy is two in n=1 and two in n=2. If we want to get an excited state, we have to promote one or more particles to higher energy levels. The first excited state would be the one with the least increase in energy. So, promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3. Then the total energy is 2E (from n=1) + 1*4E (from n=2) + 1*9E (from n=3) = 2 + 4 + 9 = 15E. But is there a configuration where the energy is lower than 15E?\n\nWait, another thought. What if instead of promoting a particle from n=2 to n=3, we have a different arrangement where particles are in higher levels but with different spin states? Wait, but spin states don't affect the energy. The energy is solely determined by the quantum number n. So, each energy level n has a certain energy, and each can hold two particles with opposite spins. So, once a level has two particles, you can't add more. Therefore, the only way to have a higher energy state is to have particles in higher n levels.\n\nSo, the first excited state would be when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3. So, the total energy is 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E. But wait, the ground state is 10E, so the first excited state is 15E? That seems like a big jump. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let's think of the possible configurations. For four fermions in a 1D box:\n\nGround state: 2 particles in n=1 (each with spin up and down), 2 particles in n=2. Total energy: 2*1²E + 2*2²E = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\nFirst excited state: To get the first excited state, we need the next lowest energy configuration. The next possible configuration would be to have one particle in a higher energy level. Since n=1 is filled with two particles, and n=2 is filled with two particles, the next available is n=3. But if we move one particle from n=2 to n=3, the configuration becomes 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, and 1 in n=3. The energy is 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E. Alternatively, is there a way to have a lower energy?\n\nWait, another possibility: If we can have three particles in n=2? But no, because n=2 can only hold two particles. Similarly, n=1 can only hold two. So, the next possible is to have one in n=3. So, 15E is the first excited state.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's another configuration where two particles are in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. But that's the same as above. Alternatively, could we have two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4? But that would be higher energy. Because n=4 is 16E, so total energy would be 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E, which is higher than 15E. So, 15E is lower. So, 15E is the first excited state.\n\nThen the second excited state would be the next one. So, after 15E, what's the next possible configuration? Let's see. The next possible could be promoting another particle from n=2 to n=3. So, two particles in n=1, zero in n=2, and two in n=3. Then the energy would be 2E + 0 + 2*9E = 20E. Alternatively, promoting one particle from n=2 to n=4. So, two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4. Then energy is 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E. Alternatively, promoting both particles from n=2 to n=3 and n=4. But which one is lower?\n\nWait, 20E vs. 22E. So, 20E is lower. So, the second excited state would be 20E. But wait, is there another configuration with energy between 15E and 20E?\n\nHmm. Let's think. If we have two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3 (15E). The next step could be promoting another particle from n=2 to n=3. But if we have two particles in n=1, zero in n=2, and two in n=3. That's 2E + 0 + 18E = 20E. Alternatively, could we have a configuration where one particle is promoted from n=1 to n=3? But n=1 is already filled with two particles. If we promote one from n=1 to n=3, then we would have one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. But wait, n=1 can only have two particles. If we take one out, we have one in n=1, which is allowed, but then we have to put the other particle in a higher level. Wait, but originally, we had two in n=1 and two in n=2. If we promote one from n=1 to n=3, then we have one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. But the energy would be 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. Hmm, 18E is between 15E and 20E. So, is this possible?\n\nWait, but can we do that? Let me check. The original configuration is two in n=1 and two in n=2. To promote a particle from n=1 to n=3, we need to move one particle from n=1 (which is filled with two) to n=3. But since n=1 can only hold two, we can't have three. So, moving one from n=1 to n=3 would leave n=1 with one particle, which is allowed. But then, the configuration would be one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. The energy would be 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. But is this a valid configuration? Let me check the Pauli exclusion principle. Each energy level can have two particles. So, n=1 has one, n=2 has two, n=3 has one. That's okay. So, this is a valid configuration. But why is this configuration not considered earlier?\n\nWait, but in the ground state, we filled the lowest energy levels first. So, the first two particles go to n=1, next two to n=2. To get the first excited state, we can either promote a particle from n=2 to n=3, resulting in 15E, or promote a particle from n=1 to n=3, resulting in 18E. But 15E is lower than 18E, so 15E is the first excited state, and 18E would be the second excited state. But wait, but if we can promote a particle from n=1 to n=3, why isn't that the first excited state?\n\nWait, no. Because promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3 requires more energy than promoting from n=2 to n=3. Let me see. The energy difference between n=2 and n=3 is 9E - 4E = 5E. The energy difference between n=1 and n=3 is 9E - 1E = 8E. So, promoting from n=2 to n=3 requires adding 5E, while promoting from n=1 to n=3 requires adding 8E. Therefore, it's more energetically favorable to promote from n=2 to n=3. Therefore, the first excited state is 15E, and promoting from n=1 would be a higher energy state. Therefore, the second excited state would be promoting another particle from n=2 to n=3, resulting in two in n=1, zero in n=2, and two in n=3, which is 2E + 0 + 18E = 20E. But wait, but if promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3 gives 18E, which is lower than 20E, then 18E would be the second excited state. So, which is it?\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think again. The possible configurations are:\n\n1. Ground state: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2. Energy: 10E.\n\n2. First excited state: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Energy: 15E.\n\n3. Second excited state: Either:\n\n   a) 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Energy: 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n\n   b) 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3. Energy: 2E + 0 + 18E = 20E.\n\n   c) 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4. Energy: 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\nSo, among these, 18E is lower than 20E, which is lower than 22E. Therefore, the second excited state should be 18E. But is the configuration with 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3 allowed? Let's check the Pauli exclusion principle. Each energy level can have two particles. So, n=1 has one, n=2 has two, n=3 has one. That's okay. But how do we get there from the ground state?\n\nTo get from the ground state (2,2,0) to (1,2,1), we need to promote one particle from n=1 to n=3. But why would that happen? Because when you promote a particle, you have to consider the energy required. Promoting from n=1 to n=3 requires more energy (8E) than promoting from n=2 to n=3 (5E). So, the first excited state is (2,1,1) with energy 15E. Then, the next possible excited state could be either promoting another particle from n=2 to n=3, resulting in (2,0,2) with energy 20E, or promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3, resulting in (1,2,1) with energy 18E. But which one is lower in energy?\n\nSince 18E is lower than 20E, the configuration (1,2,1) would be the second excited state, and (2,0,2) would be the third excited state. But is that correct? Wait, but how can we have a configuration (1,2,1)? If we start from the ground state (2,2,0), to get to (1,2,1), we need to remove a particle from n=1 and put it in n=3. But in reality, when you excite a particle, you can't just remove a particle from a lower energy level; you have to promote it. So, the excitation process would involve moving a particle from a filled level to an empty one. But in the ground state, n=1 is filled with two particles. To promote one of them, you have to move it to the next available energy level. But the next available after n=2 is n=3. However, moving a particle from n=1 to n=3 would require more energy than moving from n=2 to n=3. Therefore, the first excited state is moving one from n=2 to n=3 (15E), then the next would be moving another from n=2 to n=3 (20E), and then moving one from n=1 to n=3 (18E) would come after that? Wait, that doesn't make sense because 18E is less than 20E. So, perhaps the order is different.\n\nWait, maybe the energy levels are filled in a way that after the first excitation, the next lowest energy is achieved by promoting a different particle. Let me think in terms of the total energy.\n\nThe ground state is 10E.\n\nFirst excited state: 15E.\n\nSecond excited state: 18E.\n\nThird excited state: 20E.\n\nBut how do we get 18E? By promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3. But why would that be the second excited state instead of promoting another from n=2 to n=3?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the configuration (1,2,1) is not possible because once you have two particles in n=2, you can't have another one. Wait, no. The n=2 level can hold two particles. So, if you have two in n=2, that's allowed. So, the configuration (1,2,1) is allowed. But how do you get there? You have to promote a particle from n=1 to n=3, leaving one in n=1, keeping two in n=2, and adding one in n=3. The energy is 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. But since promoting from n=1 requires more energy, this state would be higher in energy than promoting from n=2. Therefore, the order of excited states would be:\n\n1. Ground state: 10E.\n\n2. First excited: 15E (2,1,1).\n\n3. Second excited: 18E (1,2,1).\n\n4. Third excited: 20E (2,0,2).\n\nBut the problem asks for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. So, the second excited state would be 18E. But I need to confirm this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another configuration where particles are arranged in different energy levels. For example, two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3 (15E); then, two in n=1, one in n=3, and one in n=4 (2E + 9E + 16E = 27E), which is higher. Or one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3 (18E). Then, one in n=1, one in n=2, two in n=3 (1E + 4E + 18E = 23E). Hmm, 23E is higher than 18E. So, 18E is indeed lower.\n\nBut wait, another thought. If we have two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3 (15E), and then we can also have another configuration where we have two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4 (2E + 4E + 16E = 22E). But 22E is higher than 18E, so 18E is still the next.\n\nAlternatively, could we have a configuration where three particles are in higher energy levels? For example, one in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3, and one in n=4. The energy would be 1E + 4E + 9E + 16E = 30E. That's way higher.\n\nSo, it seems that the order is:\n\n1. 10E (ground state)\n\n2. 15E (first excited)\n\n3. 18E (second excited)\n\n4. 20E (third excited)\n\nTherefore, the answer would be ground state 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.\n\nBut let me check with a different approach. Let's list all possible configurations and calculate their energies.\n\nPossible configurations for four fermions in 1D box:\n\n1. (2,2,0,0,...): 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2. Energy: 2*1 + 2*4 = 10E.\n\n2. (2,1,1,0,...): 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Energy: 2*1 + 1*4 + 1*9 = 15E.\n\n3. (1,2,1,0,...): 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Energy: 1*1 + 2*4 + 1*9 = 1 + 8 + 9 = 18E.\n\n4. (2,0,2,0,...): 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3. Energy: 2*1 + 0 + 2*9 = 2 + 0 + 18 = 20E.\n\n5. (1,1,2,0,...): 1 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 2 in n=3. Energy: 1 + 4 + 18 = 23E.\n\n6. (1,1,1,1): 1 in n=1,1,1,1 but wait, each n can have max 2, but here we have four different n's? Wait, no. If you have four particles, each in different n? But since each n can have two, you can have two in n=1, two in n=2, etc. But if you spread them out as one in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3, one in n=4, that's allowed. Each n has at most two. So, that configuration is (1,1,1,1). Energy: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30E.\n\nSo, ordering these energies:\n\n10E, 15E, 18E, 20E, 23E, 30E, etc.\n\nTherefore, the first three energy levels of the system are 10E, 15E, and 18E. Therefore, the ground state is 10E, first excited is 15E, second excited is 18E.\n\nBut wait, another thought. In some cases, when you have degenerate energy levels, the excited states might have the same energy. But in a 1D infinite potential well, each energy level n is non-degenerate except for the spin degeneracy. Each n has two states (spin up and down). So, the energy levels themselves are not degenerate except for the spin. Therefore, when we fill the states, each n can have two particles. Therefore, the configurations we considered are correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be:\n\nGround state: 10E\n\nFirst excited state: 15E\n\nSecond excited state: 18E\n\nBut let me check with another resource or example. For example, in the case of two particles, the ground state would be two in n=1 (energy 2E), first excited state would be one in n=1 and one in n=2 (energy 1E + 4E = 5E). Similarly, for three particles, ground state is two in n=1 and one in n=2 (2E + 4E = 6E), first excited state would be two in n=1 and one in n=3 (2E + 9E = 11E) or one in n=1 and two in n=2 (1E + 8E = 9E). Wait, here promoting a particle from n=1 to n=2 gives a lower energy than promoting to n=3. So, for three particles, the first excited state is 9E. So, similar logic applies here.\n\nTherefore, for four particles, promoting a particle from n=2 to n=3 gives 15E, and promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3 gives 18E. So, the order is 10E, 15E, 18E. Therefore, the answer is as such.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, summarizing:\n\n- Ground state: 2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2. Energy: 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\n- First excited state: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Energy: 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n- Second excited state: 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Energy: 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n\nYes, that seems to be the case. Therefore, the energies are 10E, 15E, and 18E for the ground, first, and second excited states respectively.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe ground state energy is \\boxed{10E}, the first excited state energy is \\boxed{15E}, and the second excited state energy is \\boxed{18E}.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745444417, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5302, prompt_tokens=1079, total_tokens=6381, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we need to consider the quantized energy levels and the Pauli exclusion principle. The energy levels for a single particle are given by \( E_n = n^2E \), where \( E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2} \).

1. **Ground State**:
   - The lowest energy configuration is achieved by filling the lowest energy levels first, with two particles in each level (due to the Pauli exclusion principle).
   - Configuration: 2 particles in \( n=1 \) and 2 particles in \( n=2 \).
   - Energy calculation: \( 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2(1^2E) + 2(2^2E) = 2E + 8E = 10E \).

2. **First Excited State**:
   - The next lowest energy configuration is obtained by promoting one particle from the highest filled level ( \( n=2 \) ) to the next available level ( \( n=3 \) ).
   - Configuration: 2 particles in \( n=1 \), 1 particle in \( n=2 \), and 1 particle in \( n=3 \).
   - Energy calculation: \( 2E_1 + 1E_2 + 1E_3 = 2(1^2E) + 1(2^2E) + 1(3^2E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E \).

3. **Second Excited State**:
   - The next lowest energy configuration is obtained by promoting one particle from \( n=1 \) to \( n=3 \), while keeping the other particles in the lowest possible levels.
   - Configuration: 1 particle in \( n=1 \), 2 particles in \( n=2 \), and 1 particle in \( n=3 \).
   - Energy calculation: \( 1E_1 + 2E_2 + 1E_3 = 1(1^2E) + 2(2^2E) + 1(3^2E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E \).

Thus, the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are:

\[
\text{Ground state:} \boxed{10E}
\]
\[
\text{First excited state:} \boxed{15E}
\]
\[
\text{Second excited state:} \boxed{18E}
\]

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

next possible state would be when we have one of the particles from n=2 promoted to n=3. But is there a state with a lower energy than 15E?

Wait, perhaps if we have three particles in n=1 and one in n=2? But wait, n=1 can only hold two particles. So, we can't have three in n=1. Similarly, n=2 can hold two. So, the maximum in n=1 is two, and the rest have to go to higher levels. So, if we have four particles, the minimum energy is two in n=1 and two in n=2. If we want to get an excited state, we have to promote one or more particles to higher energy levels. The first excited state would be the one with the least increase in energy. So, promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3. Then the total energy is 2E (from n=1) + 1*4E (from n=2) + 1*9E (from n=3) = 2 + 4 + 9 = 15E. But is there a configuration where the energy is lower than 15E?

Wait, another thought. What if instead of promoting a particle from n=2 to n=3, we have a different arrangement where particles are in higher levels but with different spin states? Wait, but spin states don't affect the energy. The energy is solely determined by the quantum number n. So, each energy level n has a certain energy, and each can hold two particles with opposite spins. So, once a level has two particles, you can't add more. Therefore, the only way to have a higher energy state is to have particles in higher n levels.

So, the first excited state would be when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3. So, the total energy is 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E. But wait, the ground state is 10E, so the first excited state is 15E? That seems like a big jump. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let's think of the possible configurations. For four fermions in a 1D box:

Ground state: 2 particles in n=1 (each with spin up and down), 2 particles in n=2. Total energy: 2*1²E + 2*2²E = 2E + 8E = 10E.

First excited state: To get the first excited state, we need the next lowest energy configuration. The next possible configuration would be to have one particle in a higher energy level. Since n=1 is filled with two particles, and n=2 is filled with two particles, the next available is n=3. But if we move one particle from n=2 to n=3, the configuration becomes 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, and 1 in n=3. The energy is 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E. Alternatively, is there a way to have a lower energy?

Wait, another possibility: If we can have three particles in n=2? But no, because n=2 can only hold two particles. Similarly, n=1 can only hold two. So, the next possible is to have one in n=3. So, 15E is the first excited state.

But wait, maybe there's another configuration where two particles are in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. But that's the same as above. Alternatively, could we have two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4? But that would be higher energy. Because n=4 is 16E, so total energy would be 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E, which is higher than 15E. So, 15E is lower. So, 15E is the first excited state.

Then the second excited state would be the next one. So, after 15E, what's the next possible configuration? Let's see. The next possible could be promoting another particle from n=2 to n=3. So, two particles in n=1, zero in n=2, and two in n=3. Then the energy would be 2E + 0 + 2*9E = 20E. Alternatively, promoting one particle from n=2 to n=4. So, two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4. Then energy is 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E. Alternatively, promoting both particles from n=2 to n=3 and n=4. But which one is lower?

Wait, 20E vs. 22E. So, 20E is lower. So, the second excited state would be 20E. But wait, is there another configuration with energy between 15E and 20E?

Hmm. Let's think. If we have two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3 (15E). The next step could be promoting another particle from n=2 to n=3. But if we have two particles in n=1, zero in n=2, and two in n=3. That's 2E + 0 + 18E = 20E. Alternatively, could we have a configuration where one particle is promoted from n=1 to n=3? But n=1 is already filled with two particles. If we promote one from n=1 to n=3, then we would have one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. But wait, n=1 can only have two particles. If we take one out, we have one in n=1, which is allowed, but then we have to put the other particle in a higher level. Wait, but originally, we had two in n=1 and two in n=2. If we promote one from n=1 to n=3, then we have one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. But the energy would be 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. Hmm, 18E is between 15E and 20E. So, is this possible?

Wait, but can we do that? Let me check. The original configuration is two in n=1 and two in n=2. To promote a particle from n=1 to n=3, we need to move one particle from n=1 (which is filled with two) to n=3. But since n=1 can only hold two, we can't have three. So, moving one from n=1 to n=3 would leave n=1 with one particle, which is allowed. But then, the configuration would be one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. The energy would be 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. But is this a valid configuration? Let me check the Pauli exclusion principle. Each energy level can have two particles. So, n=1 has one, n=2 has two, n=3 has one. That's okay. So, this is a valid configuration. But why is this configuration not considered earlier?

Wait, but in the ground state, we filled the lowest energy levels first. So, the first two particles go to n=1, next two to n=2. To get the first excited state, we can either promote a particle from n=2 to n=3, resulting in 15E, or promote a particle from n=1 to n=3, resulting in 18E. But 15E is lower than 18E, so 15E is the first excited state, and 18E would be the second excited state. But wait, but if we can promote a particle from n=1 to n=3, why isn't that the first excited state?

Wait, no. Because promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3 requires more energy than promoting from n=2 to n=3. Let me see. The energy difference between n=2 and n=3 is 9E - 4E = 5E. The energy difference between n=1 and n=3 is 9E - 1E = 8E. So, promoting from n=2 to n=3 requires adding 5E, while promoting from n=1 to n=3 requires adding 8E. Therefore, it's more energetically favorable to promote from n=2 to n=3. Therefore, the first excited state is 15E, and promoting from n=1 would be a higher energy state. Therefore, the second excited state would be promoting another particle from n=2 to n=3, resulting in two in n=1, zero in n=2, and two in n=3, which is 2E + 0 + 18E = 20E. But wait, but if promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3 gives 18E, which is lower than 20E, then 18E would be the second excited state. So, which is it?

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think again. The possible configurations are:

1. Ground state: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2. Energy: 10E.

2. First excited state: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Energy: 15E.

3. Second excited state: Either:

   a) 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Energy: 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.

   b) 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3. Energy: 2E + 0 + 18E = 20E.

   c) 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4. Energy: 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.

So, among these, 18E is lower than 20E, which is lower than 22E. Therefore, the second excited state should be 18E. But is the configuration with 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3 allowed? Let's check the Pauli exclusion principle. Each energy level can have two particles. So, n=1 has one, n=2 has two, n=3 has one. That's okay. But how do we get there from the ground state?

To get from the ground state (2,2,0) to (1,2,1), we need to promote one particle from n=1 to n=3. But why would that happen? Because when you promote a particle, you have to consider the energy required. Promoting from n=1 to n=3 requires more energy (8E) than promoting from n=2 to n=3 (5E). So, the first excited state is (2,1,1) with energy 15E. Then, the next possible excited state could be either promoting another particle from n=2 to n=3, resulting in (2,0,2) with energy 20E, or promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3, resulting in (1,2,1) with energy 18E. But which one is lower in energy?

Since 18E is lower than 20E, the configuration (1,2,1) would be the second excited state, and (2,0,2) would be the third excited state. But is that correct? Wait, but how can we have a configuration (1,2,1)? If we start from the ground state (2,2,0), to get to (1,2,1), we need to remove a particle from n=1 and put it in n=3. But in reality, when you excite a particle, you can't just remove a particle from a lower energy level; you have to promote it. So, the excitation process would involve moving a particle from a filled level to an empty one. But in the ground state, n=1 is filled with two particles. To promote one of them, you have to move it to the next available energy level. But the next available after n=2 is n=3. However, moving a particle from n=1 to n=3 would require more energy than moving from n=2 to n=3. Therefore, the first excited state is moving one from n=2 to n=3 (15E), then the next would be moving another from n=2 to n=3 (20E), and then moving one from n=1 to n=3 (18E) would come after that? Wait, that doesn't make sense because 18E is less than 20E. So, perhaps the order is different.

Wait, maybe the energy levels are filled in a way that after the first excitation, the next lowest energy is achieved by promoting a different particle. Let me think in terms of the total energy.

The ground state is 10E.

First excited state: 15E.

Second excited state: 18E.

Third excited state: 20E.

But how do we get 18E? By promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3. But why would that be the second excited state instead of promoting another from n=2 to n=3?

Alternatively, maybe the configuration (1,2,1) is not possible because once you have two particles in n=2, you can't have another one. Wait, no. The n=2 level can hold two particles. So, if you have two in n=2, that's allowed. So, the configuration (1,2,1) is allowed. But how do you get there? You have to promote a particle from n=1 to n=3, leaving one in n=1, keeping two in n=2, and adding one in n=3. The energy is 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. But since promoting from n=1 requires more energy, this state would be higher in energy than promoting from n=2. Therefore, the order of excited states would be:

1. Ground state: 10E.

2. First excited: 15E (2,1,1).

3. Second excited: 18E (1,2,1).

4. Third excited: 20E (2,0,2).

But the problem asks for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. So, the second excited state would be 18E. But I need to confirm this.

Alternatively, maybe there's another configuration where particles are arranged in different energy levels. For example, two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3 (15E); then, two in n=1, one in n=3, and one in n=4 (2E + 9E + 16E = 27E), which is higher. Or one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3 (18E). Then, one in n=1, one in n=2, two in n=3 (1E + 4E + 18E = 23E). Hmm, 23E is higher than 18E. So, 18E is indeed lower.

But wait, another thought. If we have two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3 (15E), and then we can also have another configuration where we have two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4 (2E + 4E + 16E = 22E). But 22E is higher than 18E, so 18E is still the next.

Alternatively, could we have a configuration where three particles are in higher energy levels? For example, one in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3, and one in n=4. The energy would be 1E + 4E + 9E + 16E = 30E. That's way higher.

So, it seems that the order is:

1. 10E (ground state)

2. 15E (first excited)

3. 18E (second excited)

4. 20E (third excited)

Therefore, the answer would be ground state 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

But let me check with a different approach. Let's list all possible configurations and calculate their energies.

Possible configurations for four fermions in 1D box:

1. (2,2,0,0,...): 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2. Energy: 2*1 + 2*4 = 10E.

2. (2,1,1,0,...): 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Energy: 2*1 + 1*4 + 1*9 = 15E.

3. (1,2,1,0,...): 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Energy: 1*1 + 2*4 + 1*9 = 1 + 8 + 9 = 18E.

4. (2,0,2,0,...): 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3. Energy: 2*1 + 0 + 2*9 = 2 + 0 + 18 = 20E.

5. (1,1,2,0,...): 1 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 2 in n=3. Energy: 1 + 4 + 18 = 23E.

6. (1,1,1,1): 1 in n=1,1,1,1 but wait, each n can have max 2, but here we have four different n's? Wait, no. If you have four particles, each in different n? But since each n can have two, you can have two in n=1, two in n=2, etc. But if you spread them out as one in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3, one in n=4, that's allowed. Each n has at most two. So, that configuration is (1,1,1,1). Energy: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30E.

So, ordering these energies:

10E, 15E, 18E, 20E, 23E, 30E, etc.

Therefore, the first three energy levels of the system are 10E, 15E, and 18E. Therefore, the ground state is 10E, first excited is 15E, second excited is 18E.

But wait, another thought. In some cases, when you have degenerate energy levels, the excited states might have the same energy. But in a 1D infinite potential well, each energy level n is non-degenerate except for the spin degeneracy. Each n has two states (spin up and down). So, the energy levels themselves are not degenerate except for the spin. Therefore, when we fill the states, each n can have two particles. Therefore, the configurations we considered are correct.

Therefore, the answer should be:

Ground state: 10E

First excited state: 15E

Second excited state: 18E

But let me check with another resource or example. For example, in the case of two particles, the ground state would be two in n=1 (energy 2E), first excited state would be one in n=1 and one in n=2 (energy 1E + 4E = 5E). Similarly, for three particles, ground state is two in n=1 and one in n=2 (2E + 4E = 6E), first excited state would be two in n=1 and one in n=3 (2E + 9E = 11E) or one in n=1 and two in n=2 (1E + 8E = 9E). Wait, here promoting a particle from n=1 to n=2 gives a lower energy than promoting to n=3. So, for three particles, the first excited state is 9E. So, similar logic applies here.

Therefore, for four particles, promoting a particle from n=2 to n=3 gives 15E, and promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3 gives 18E. So, the order is 10E, 15E, 18E. Therefore, the answer is as such.

I think that's the correct approach. So, summarizing:

- Ground state: 2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2. Energy: 2E + 8E = 10E.

- First excited state: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Energy: 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.

- Second excited state: 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Energy: 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.

Yes, that seems to be the case. Therefore, the energies are 10E, 15E, and 18E for the ground, first, and second excited states respectively.

**Final Answer**
The ground state energy is \boxed{10E}, the first excited state energy is \boxed{15E}, and the second excited state energy is \boxed{18E}.

Therefore, the first excited state should have energy 15E.\n\nFor the second excited state, I need to find the next energy level beyond the first excited state. This would involve promoting another particle to a higher energy level. There are two possibilities here: either promote another particle from n=2 to n=3, resulting in two particles in n=1, zero in n=2, and two in n=3, or promote a particle from n=3 to n=4. Let's calculate both possibilities.\n\nFirst, promoting another particle from n=2 to n=3: The configuration would be two particles in n=1, zero in n=2, and two in n=3. The energy would be 2*(1²)E + 0*(2²)E + 2*(3²)E = 2E + 0 + 18E = 20E.\n\nAlternatively, promoting a particle from n=3 to n=4: The configuration would be two particles in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3, and one in n=4. However, since we only have four particles, this would require a fifth particle, which we don't have. Wait, no. Let me check again. If we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3, that's four particles. If we promote the particle in n=3 to n=4, then we would have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. The energy here would be 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E. But 22E is higher than 20E, so the configuration with two particles in n=3 would be lower in energy. Therefore, the second excited state would be 20E.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there's another configuration. Let me think again. If we have two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3 (15E), the next possible state could be two in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3, but that would require five particles. No, we only have four. Alternatively, maybe two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. Wait, but that would be 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E. Alternatively, maybe two in n=1, one in n=3, and one in n=4. But that's 2E + 9E + 16E = 27E, which is even higher. Alternatively, maybe three particles in n=1 and one in n=2. But since each level can hold two particles, three in n=1 would require that one of the spin states is triply occupied, which violates the Pauli exclusion principle. So that's not allowed. Therefore, the next possible configuration after 15E is 20E, where two particles are in n=3. Therefore, the second excited state is 20E.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The first excited state is when we have one particle promoted from n=2 to n=3, resulting in two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3 (15E). The next possible state would be promoting another particle from n=2 to n=3, but since there's only one particle left in n=2, we can't promote another. Wait, no. Wait, in the first excited state, we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. To get the second excited state, we need to promote another particle. But the only particles left in lower energy levels are the two in n=1. But since n=1 is already filled with two particles, we can't promote from there. Wait, perhaps the next possible configuration is to have two in n=1, zero in n=2, and two in n=3. But how do we get there? If we start from the ground state (two in n=1, two in n=2), promoting two particles from n=2 to n=3. Each promotion would take one particle from n=2 to n=3. So the first promotion gives us 15E, and the second promotion would take the remaining particle in n=2 to n=3, but n=3 can take two particles. So after promoting both particles from n=2 to n=3, we would have two in n=1 and two in n=3, which would be 2E + 18E = 20E. Therefore, the second excited state is 20E.\n\nAlternatively, could there be a configuration where one particle is promoted to n=4 instead of both to n=3? Let's see. If we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4, the energy would be 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E, which is higher than 20E, so 20E is lower. Therefore, the second excited state is 20E.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's another way. Let me check if there's a configuration where particles are arranged in different energy levels that I haven't considered. For example, if we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3 (15E), and then the next possible state would be two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3 (20E). Then, the next would be two in n=1, one in n=3, and one in n=4 (2E + 9E + 16E = 27E). So 20E is indeed the next lowest after 15E. Therefore, the second excited state is 20E.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more. The ground state is 10E. The first excited state is 15E. The second excited state is 20E. Is there any other possible configuration between 15E and 20E? For example, if we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3 (15E), and then maybe one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. But that would require three particles in n=2, which is impossible because each level can only hold two. So that's not allowed. Alternatively, two in n=1, two in n=3. That's 2E + 18E = 20E. So no, there's no configuration between 15E and 20E. Therefore, the second excited state is 20E.\n\nWait, but another thought: maybe if we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. That would be 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E, which is higher than 20E, so 20E is still the next. Therefore, the order is 10E, 15E, 20E.\n\nBut let me check once again. The possible configurations for four fermions in a 1D well:\n\nGround state: Fill the lowest levels with two particles each. So n=1 (2), n=2 (2). Total energy: 2*1²E + 2*2²E = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\nFirst excited state: Next possible configuration. Since we can't have three particles in any level, the next is to have one particle promoted from n=2 to n=3. So n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). Energy: 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\nSecond excited state: Now, the next possible configuration would be promoting another particle from n=2 to n=3. But since there's only one left in n=2, we can't promote another. Wait, no. Wait, in the first excited state, we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. To get the next state, we can promote the remaining particle in n=2 to n=3. But n=3 can take another particle (since it's only holding one). So promoting that last particle from n=2 to n=3 would result in two in n=1 and two in n=3. The energy here is 2E + 18E = 20E. Alternatively, could we promote a particle from n=1 to n=3? But that would require more energy. Let's see: if we take one from n=1 (which is filled with two) and put it in n=3, then we would have one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. But that's three particles in total. Wait, no. Wait, original configuration is two in n=1, two in n=2. If we promote one from n=1 to n=3, we would have one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. But that's four particles. The energy would be 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. Wait, but this is lower than 15E? No, that can't be. Wait, 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E, which is higher than 15E. But this configuration would actually have higher energy than the first excited state. Therefore, promoting a particle from n=1 to a higher level is not favorable. Therefore, the next possible configuration after 15E is 20E.\n\nWait, but this suggests that promoting a particle from n=2 to n=3 gives 15E, and promoting another from n=2 to n=3 (but there's only one left) gives 20E. Alternatively, maybe promoting a particle from n=3 to n=4, but that would require more energy. Let me check:\n\nIf in the first excited state (15E), we have two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. If we promote the particle in n=3 to n=4, we would have two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4. The energy here is 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E. But 22E is higher than 20E, so the configuration with two in n=3 is lower. Therefore, the second excited state is indeed 20E.\n\nTherefore, the energies are:\n\nGround state: 10E\n\nFirst excited state: 15E\n\nSecond excited state: 20E\n\nBut wait, let me check once more. Suppose we have four particles. The possible configurations:\n\n1. All in the lowest possible levels: n=1 (2), n=2 (2) → 10E.\n\n2. Next, move one from n=2 to n=3: n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1) → 15E.\n\n3. Then, move the remaining one from n=2 to n=3: n=1 (2), n=3 (2) → 20E.\n\nAlternatively, could there be a configuration where we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4? That would be 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E, which is higher than 20E. So no, 20E is lower. Therefore, the second excited state is 20E.\n\nAnother check: the order of energy levels. The energy levels for the particles are n=1, 2, 3, 4, etc. Each can hold two particles. For four particles, the ground state fills n=1 and n=2. The first excited state would have one particle in a higher level. The next would have two particles in the next higher level. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the energies are:\n\n- Ground state: 10E\n\n- First excited state: 15E\n\n- Second excited state: 20E\n\nI think that's the correct answer.

To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we need to consider the Pauli exclusion principle, which allows at most two particles per energy level.

1. **Ground State**:
   - The lowest energy levels are filled first. Each energy level \( n \) can hold up to two particles.
   - The four particles will occupy the lowest two levels: two particles in \( n=1 \) and two particles in \( n=2 \).
   - Energy calculation: \( 2 \times E_1 + 2 \times E_2 = 2 \times 1^2E + 2 \times 2^2E = 2E + 8E = 10E \).

2. **First Excited State**:
   - The next lowest energy configuration involves promoting one particle from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \).
   - Configuration: two particles in \( n=1 \), one particle in \( n=2 \), and one particle in \( n=3 \).
   - Energy calculation: \( 2 \times E_1 + 1 \times E_2 + 1 \times E_3 = 2 \times 1^2E + 1 \times 2^2E + 1 \times 3^2E = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E \).

3. **Second Excited State**:
   - The next configuration involves promoting the remaining particle from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \).
   - Configuration: two particles in \( n=1 \) and two particles in \( n=3 \).
   - Energy calculation: \( 2 \times E_1 + 2 \times E_3 = 2 \times 1^2E + 2 \times 3^2E = 2E + 18E = 20E \).

Thus, the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are:

\[
\text{Ground state: } \boxed{10E}
\]
\[
\text{First excited state: } \boxed{15E}
\]
\[
\text{Second excited state: } \boxed{20E}
\]

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

The next possible configuration would require moving a particle to a higher energy level, which in this case is n=3. Therefore, the first excited state should have energy 15E.

For the second excited state, I need to find the next energy level beyond the first excited state. This would involve promoting another particle to a higher energy level. There are two possibilities here: either promote another particle from n=2 to n=3, resulting in two particles in n=1, zero in n=2, and two in n=3, or promote a particle from n=3 to n=4. Let's calculate both possibilities.

First, promoting another particle from n=2 to n=3: The configuration would be two particles in n=1, zero in n=2, and two in n=3. The energy would be 2*(1²)E + 0*(2²)E + 2*(3²)E = 2E + 0 + 18E = 20E.

Alternatively, promoting a particle from n=3 to n=4: The configuration would be two particles in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3, and one in n=4. However, since we only have four particles, this would require a fifth particle, which we don't have. Wait, no. Let me check again. If we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3, that's four particles. If we promote the particle in n=3 to n=4, then we would have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. The energy here would be 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E. But 22E is higher than 20E, so the configuration with two particles in n=3 would be lower in energy. Therefore, the second excited state would be 20E.

But wait, perhaps there's another configuration. Let me think again. If we have two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3 (15E), the next possible state could be two in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3, but that would require five particles. No, we only have four. Alternatively, maybe two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. Wait, but that would be 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E. Alternatively, maybe two in n=1, one in n=3, and one in n=4. But that's 2E + 9E + 16E = 27E, which is even higher. Alternatively, maybe three particles in n=1 and one in n=2. But since each level can hold two particles, three in n=1 would require that one of the spin states is triply occupied, which violates the Pauli exclusion principle. So that's not allowed. Therefore, the next possible configuration after 15E is 20E, where two particles are in n=3. Therefore, the second excited state is 20E.

Wait, but let me check again. The first excited state is when we have one particle promoted from n=2 to n=3, resulting in two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3 (15E). The next possible state would be promoting another particle from n=2 to n=3, but since there's only one particle left in n=2, we can't promote another. Wait, no. Wait, in the first excited state, we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. To get the second excited state, we need to promote another particle. But the only particles left in lower energy levels are the two in n=1. But since n=1 is already filled with two particles, we can't promote from there. Wait, perhaps the next possible configuration is to have two in n=1, zero in n=2, and two in n=3. But how do we get there? If we start from the ground state (two in n=1, two in n=2), promoting two particles from n=2 to n=3. Each promotion would take one particle from n=2 to n=3. So the first promotion gives us 15E, and the second promotion would take the remaining particle in n=2 to n=3, but n=3 can take two particles. So after promoting both particles from n=2 to n=3, we would have two in n=1 and two in n=3, which would be 2E + 18E = 20E. Therefore, the second excited state is 20E.

Alternatively, could there be a configuration where one particle is promoted to n=4 instead of both to n=3? Let's see. If we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4, the energy would be 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E, which is higher than 20E, so 20E is lower. Therefore, the second excited state is 20E.

Wait, but perhaps there's another way. Let me check if there's a configuration where particles are arranged in different energy levels that I haven't considered. For example, if we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3 (15E), and then the next possible state would be two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3 (20E). Then, the next would be two in n=1, one in n=3, and one in n=4 (2E + 9E + 16E = 27E). So 20E is indeed the next lowest after 15E. Therefore, the second excited state is 20E.

Wait, but let me confirm once more. The ground state is 10E. The first excited state is 15E. The second excited state is 20E. Is there any other possible configuration between 15E and 20E? For example, if we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3 (15E), and then maybe one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. But that would require three particles in n=2, which is impossible because each level can only hold two. So that's not allowed. Alternatively, two in n=1, two in n=3. That's 2E + 18E = 20E. So no, there's no configuration between 15E and 20E. Therefore, the second excited state is 20E.

Wait, but another thought: maybe if we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. That would be 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E, which is higher than 20E, so 20E is still the next. Therefore, the order is 10E, 15E, 20E.

But let me check once again. The possible configurations for four fermions in a 1D well:

Ground state: Fill the lowest levels with two particles each. So n=1 (2), n=2 (2). Total energy: 2*1²E + 2*2²E = 2E + 8E = 10E.

First excited state: Next possible configuration. Since we can't have three particles in any level, the next is to have one particle promoted from n=2 to n=3. So n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). Energy: 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.

Second excited state: Now, the next possible configuration would be promoting another particle from n=2 to n=3. But since there's only one left in n=2, we can't promote another. Wait, no. Wait, in the first excited state, we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. To get the next state, we can promote the remaining particle in n=2 to n=3. But n=3 can take another particle (since it's only holding one). So promoting that last particle from n=2 to n=3 would result in two in n=1 and two in n=3. The energy here is 2E + 18E = 20E. Alternatively, could we promote a particle from n=1 to n=3? But that would require more energy. Let's see: if we take one from n=1 (which is filled with two) and put it in n=3, then we would have one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. But that's three particles in total. Wait, no. Wait, original configuration is two in n=1, two in n=2. If we promote one from n=1 to n=3, we would have one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. But that's four particles. The energy would be 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. Wait, but this is lower than 15E? No, that can't be. Wait, 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E, which is higher than 15E. But this configuration would actually have higher energy than the first excited state. Therefore, promoting a particle from n=1 to a higher level is not favorable. Therefore, the next possible configuration after 15E is 20E.

Wait, but this suggests that promoting a particle from n=2 to n=3 gives 15E, and promoting another from n=2 to n=3 (but there's only one left) gives 20E. Alternatively, maybe promoting a particle from n=3 to n=4, but that would require more energy. Let me check:

If in the first excited state (15E), we have two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. If we promote the particle in n=3 to n=4, we would have two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4. The energy here is 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E. But 22E is higher than 20E, so the configuration with two in n=3 is lower. Therefore, the second excited state is indeed 20E.

Therefore, the energies are:

Ground state: 10E

First excited state: 15E

Second excited state: 20E

But wait, let me check once more. Suppose we have four particles. The possible configurations:

1. All in the lowest possible levels: n=1 (2), n=2 (2) → 10E.

2. Next, move one from n=2 to n=3: n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1) → 15E.

3. Then, move the remaining one from n=2 to n=3: n=1 (2), n=3 (2) → 20E.

Alternatively, could there be a configuration where we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4? That would be 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E, which is higher than 20E. So no, 20E is lower. Therefore, the second excited state is 20E.

Another check: the order of energy levels. The energy levels for the particles are n=1, 2, 3, 4, etc. Each can hold two particles. For four particles, the ground state fills n=1 and n=2. The first excited state would have one particle in a higher level. The next would have two particles in the next higher level. So yes, that seems correct.

Therefore, the energies are:

- Ground state: 10E

- First excited state: 15E

- Second excited state: 20E

I think that's the correct answer. Let me just confirm by considering the possible configurations and their energies once more.

Ground state: two in n=1 (2E), two in n=2 (8E) → total 10E.

First excited: two in n=1 (2E), one in n=2 (4E), one in n=3 (9E) → total 15E.

Second excited: two in n=1 (2E), two in n=3 (18E) → total 20E.

Yes, that seems correct. There's no lower energy configuration possible for the second excited state than 20E. Therefore, the answer should be as above.


**Final Answer**
The ground state energy is \boxed{10E}, the first excited state energy is \boxed{15E}, and the second excited state energy is \boxed{20E}.

So that's impossible. Similarly, two in n=1, two in n=2 is the maximum for the first two levels. So, the next possible configuration is indeed two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. Therefore, the first excited state is 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\nBut wait, another thought: if we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3, but perhaps there's a lower energy configuration by having different distributions. For example, two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Alternatively, two in n=1, two in n=2, but that's the ground state. So, the first excited state must be the next possible configuration where one particle is promoted. So, 15E.\n\nNow, the second excited state. Following the same logic, after the first excited state, the next higher energy state would involve promoting another particle. Let's see. The first excited state is two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. To get the second excited state, we can either promote another particle from n=2 to n=3, but n=2 only has one particle left. Alternatively, promote a particle from n=1 to a higher level. However, n=1 has two particles. If we promote one from n=1 to n=3, then we would have one in n=1, one in n=2, and two in n=3. Let's compute the energy here: 1E + 4E + 2*(9E) = 1E + 4E + 18E = 23E. Alternatively, promoting a particle from n=1 to n=4: 1E + 4E + 9E + 16E = 30E. That's higher. Alternatively, promoting the remaining particle in n=2 to n=3: two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3. Then energy is 2E + 0 + 2*(9E) = 20E. Wait, that's 2E + 18E = 20E. Comparing 20E vs. 23E. Which is lower? 20E is lower. So, is that possible?\n\nWait, if we have two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3. But how do we get there? From the first excited state (two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3), promoting the remaining n=2 particle to n=3. So, that would result in two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3. The energy here is 2E + 0 + 18E = 20E. Alternatively, promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3, which would result in one in n=1, one in n=2, two in n=3, which is 1E + 4E + 18E = 23E. So, 20E is lower than 23E, so 20E would be the second excited state. But is that possible?\n\nWait, but in the first excited state, we have two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. To get to the second excited state, we can either promote the remaining n=2 particle to n=3 (resulting in two in n=1, two in n=3) or promote a particle from n=1 to n=2. But n=2 already has one particle. If we promote a particle from n=1 to n=2, then n=2 would have two particles, which is allowed. So, that configuration would be one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3. Let's compute that energy: 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. Wait, that's lower than 20E. But that can't be, because 18E is lower than 20E, which would mean that this is a lower energy state than the previous one. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Let's re-examine.\n\nIn the ground state, we have two in n=1, two in n=2 (total energy 10E). The first excited state is when we have two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3 (15E). Then, the next possible state could be either:\n\n1. Promoting the remaining n=2 particle to n=3: two in n=1, two in n=3 (20E).\n\n2. Promoting a particle from n=1 to n=2: but n=2 already has one particle, so adding another would make two. So, one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3. The energy here is 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n\nBut 18E is lower than 20E, so this would actually be a lower energy state than the two in n=3. Therefore, the order of excited states would be:\n\nGround state: 10E.\n\nFirst excited: 15E.\n\nSecond excited: 18E.\n\nBut wait, that contradicts the previous thought. So, perhaps the second excited state is 18E. Let's check.\n\nWait, but how can promoting a particle from n=1 to n=2 result in a lower energy than promoting from n=2 to n=3? Because n=2 is lower than n=3. So, moving a particle from n=1 to n=2 would require less energy than moving from n=2 to n=3. Wait, but in terms of total energy, moving a particle from n=1 to n=2 would increase the energy by (4E - 1E) = 3E, whereas moving a particle from n=2 to n=3 would increase by (9E - 4E) = 5E. So, moving from n=1 to n=2 is a smaller energy jump. Therefore, the configuration with one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3 (18E) would be lower in energy than two in n=1, two in n=3 (20E). Therefore, the second excited state is 18E.\n\nBut how does that fit into the sequence? Let's see:\n\nGround state: two in n=1, two in n=2: 10E.\n\nFirst excited: two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3: 15E.\n\nSecond excited: one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3: 18E.\n\nThird excited: one in n=1, one in n=2, two in n=3: 23E.\n\nFourth excited: two in n=1, two in n=3: 20E. Wait, but 20E is lower than 23E. So, perhaps my ordering is wrong.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let's list all possible configurations and their energies:\n\n1. All particles in the lowest possible levels: two in n=1, two in n=2. Energy: 2*1E + 2*4E = 10E. Ground state.\n\n2. Next, promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3: two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. Energy: 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E. First excited.\n\n3. Promoting another particle from n=2 to n=3: two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3. Energy: 2E + 0 + 18E = 20E. But this is higher than 15E.\n\nAlternatively, from the first excited state (15E), promoting a particle from n=1 to n=2: but n=2 already has one particle. So, moving one from n=1 to n=2 would result in one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3. Energy: 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. So, 18E is lower than 20E, so this would be the second excited state.\n\nAlternatively, from the ground state, promoting two particles from n=2 to n=3: but that would require two steps. So, the order of states is:\n\nGround: 10E.\n\nFirst excited: 15E.\n\nSecond excited: 18E.\n\nThird excited: 20E.\n\nFourth excited: 23E.\n\nEtc.\n\nTherefore, the second excited state is 18E.\n\nBut let's confirm this. The key is that when you have multiple ways to promote particles, the one that results in the least energy increase is the next excited state. So, moving a particle from n=1 to n=2 (which increases energy by 3E) is a smaller jump than moving a particle from n=2 to n=3 (which increases by 5E). Therefore, after the first excited state (15E), the next possible state is moving a particle from n=1 to n=2, leading to 18E. Then, moving a particle from n=2 to n=3 would lead to 20E, and so on.\n\nTherefore, the second excited state is 18E.\n\nBut let's check if that configuration is allowed. If we have one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3, that's four particles. Each level n=1 and n=3 have one and one particles, but n=2 has two. Since each level can hold two particles (spin up and down), this is allowed. So, that's a valid configuration.\n\nTherefore, the energies are:\n\nGround state: 10E.\n\nFirst excited: 15E.\n\nSecond excited: 18E.\n\nBut let me cross-verify with another approach. The total energy is the sum of the individual energies. For fermions in a 1D box, the filling is done by the lowest energy levels with two particles per level. So, the ground state would have the first two levels filled (n=1 and n=2), each with two particles. Then, the first excited state would be when one particle is promoted from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the next available level (n=3). The second excited state would be when another particle is promoted, but the question is from where.\n\nAlternatively, after promoting one particle to n=3, the next promotion could be either another from n=2 to n=3 (if possible) or from a lower level. But since n=2 now has one particle left, promoting that would leave n=2 empty, but n=3 would have two. Alternatively, promoting a particle from n=1 to n=2. But n=2 can take another particle. So, moving a particle from n=1 to n=2 would result in one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. This is a lower energy increase than moving the remaining n=2 particle to n=3. Therefore, the second excited state is indeed 18E.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be:\n\nGround state: 10E.\n\nFirst excited: 15E.\n\nSecond excited: 18E.\n\nBut let me check if there's another possible configuration. For example, if we have two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. The energy would be 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E. But that's higher than 18E, so not the second excited state.\n\nAlternatively, two in n=1, one in n=3, one in n=4: 2E + 9E + 16E = 27E. Even higher.\n\nAlternatively, one in n=1, one in n=2, two in n=3: 1E + 4E + 18E = 23E. Still higher than 18E.\n\nTherefore, the second excited state is indeed 18E.\n\nAnother way to think about this is by considering the possible configurations and their corresponding energies:\n\n1. Ground state: (n=1)^2 (n=2)^2 → 2*1E + 2*4E = 10E.\n\n2. First excited: (n=1)^2 (n=2)^1 (n=3)^1 → 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n3. Second excited: (n=1)^1 (n=2)^2 (n=3)^1 → 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n\n4. Third excited: (n=1)^2 (n=3)^2 → 2E + 18E = 20E.\n\n5. Fourth excited: (n=1)^1 (n=2)^1 (n=3)^2 → 1E + 4E + 18E = 23E.\n\nAnd so on. Therefore, the order of energies is 10E, 15E, 18E, 20E, 23E, etc. Hence, the second excited state is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nGround state: 10E.\n\nFirst excited state: 15E.\n\nSecond excited state: 18E.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are \\boxed{10E}, \\boxed{15E}, and \\boxed{18E} respectively.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745444801, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3504, prompt_tokens=868, total_tokens=4372, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we start by noting that each energy level \( E_n = n^2E \), where \( E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2} \). Due to the Pauli exclusion principle, each energy level can hold at most two particles.

1. **Ground State**:
   - The lowest energy levels are filled first. The first two particles occupy the \( n=1 \) level, and the next two particles occupy the \( n=2 \) level.
   - Total energy: \( 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2(1^2E) + 2(2^2E) = 2E + 8E = 10E \).

2. **First Excited State**:
   - One particle from the \( n=2 \) level is promoted to the \( n=3 \) level.
   - Configuration: two particles in \( n=1 \), one particle in \( n=2 \), and one particle in \( n=3 \).
   - Total energy: \( 2E_1 + 1E_2 + 1E_3 = 2(1^2E) + 1(2^2E) + 1(3^2E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E \).

3. **Second Excited State**:
   - A particle from the \( n=1 \) level is promoted to the \( n=2 \) level, which can now hold two particles again.
   - Configuration: one particle in \( n=1 \), two particles in \( n=2 \), and one particle in \( n=3 \).
   - Total energy: \( 1E_1 + 2E_2 + 1E_3 = 1(1^2E) + 2(2^2E) + 1(3^2E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E \).

Thus, the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are \(\boxed{10E}\), \(\boxed{15E}\), and \(\boxed{18E}\) respectively.

The first excited state would then be two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. But wait, perhaps there's another configuration with higher multiplicity? Let me check.

Alternatively, if we have three particles in n=1 and one in n=2. But wait, n=1 can only hold two particles. So that's impossible. Similarly, two in n=1, two in n=2 is the maximum for the first two levels. So, the next possible configuration is indeed two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. Therefore, the first excited state is 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.

But wait, another thought: if we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3, but perhaps there's a lower energy configuration by having different distributions. For example, two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Alternatively, two in n=1, two in n=2, but that's the ground state. So, the first excited state must be the next possible configuration where one particle is promoted. So, 15E.

Now, the second excited state. Following the same logic, after the first excited state, the next higher energy state would involve promoting another particle. Let's see. The first excited state is two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. To get the second excited state, we can either promote another particle from n=2 to n=3, but n=2 only has one particle left. Alternatively, promote a particle from n=1 to a higher level. However, n=1 has two particles. If we promote one from n=1 to n=3, then we would have one in n=1, one in n=2, and two in n=3. Let's compute the energy here: 1E + 4E + 2*(9E) = 1E + 4E + 18E = 23E. Alternatively, promoting a particle from n=1 to n=4: 1E + 4E + 9E + 16E = 30E. That's higher. Alternatively, promoting the remaining particle in n=2 to n=3: two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3. Then energy is 2E + 0 + 2*(9E) = 20E. Wait, that's 2E + 18E = 20E. Comparing 20E vs. 23E. Which is lower? 20E is lower. So, is that possible?

Wait, if we have two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3. But how do we get there? From the first excited state (two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3), promoting the remaining n=2 particle to n=3. So, that would result in two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3. The energy here is 2E + 0 + 18E = 20E. Alternatively, promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3, which would result in one in n=1, one in n=2, two in n=3, which is 1E + 4E + 18E = 23E. So, 20E is lower than 23E, so 20E would be the second excited state. But is that possible?

Wait, but in the first excited state, we have two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. To get to the second excited state, we can either promote the remaining n=2 particle to n=3 (resulting in two in n=1, two in n=3) or promote a particle from n=1 to n=2. But n=2 already has one particle. If we promote a particle from n=1 to n=2, then n=2 would have two particles, which is allowed. So, that configuration would be one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3. Let's compute that energy: 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. Wait, that's lower than 20E. But that can't be, because 18E is lower than 20E, which would mean that this is a lower energy state than the previous one. But how?

Wait, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Let's re-examine.

In the ground state, we have two in n=1, two in n=2 (total energy 10E). The first excited state is when we have two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3 (15E). Then, the next possible state could be either:

1. Promoting the remaining n=2 particle to n=3: two in n=1, two in n=3 (20E).

2. Promoting a particle from n=1 to n=2: but n=2 already has one particle, so adding another would make two. So, one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3. The energy here is 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.

But 18E is lower than 20E, so this would actually be a lower energy state than the two in n=3. Therefore, the order of excited states would be:

Ground state: 10E.

First excited: 15E.

Second excited: 18E.

But wait, that contradicts the previous thought. So, perhaps the second excited state is 18E. Let's check.

Wait, but how can promoting a particle from n=1 to n=2 result in a lower energy than promoting from n=2 to n=3? Because n=2 is lower than n=3. So, moving a particle from n=1 to n=2 would require less energy than moving from n=2 to n=3. Wait, but in terms of total energy, moving a particle from n=1 to n=2 would increase the energy by (4E - 1E) = 3E, whereas moving a particle from n=2 to n=3 would increase by (9E - 4E) = 5E. So, moving from n=1 to n=2 is a smaller energy jump. Therefore, the configuration with one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3 (18E) would be lower in energy than two in n=1, two in n=3 (20E). Therefore, the second excited state is 18E.

But how does that fit into the sequence? Let's see:

Ground state: two in n=1, two in n=2: 10E.

First excited: two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3: 15E.

Second excited: one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3: 18E.

Third excited: one in n=1, one in n=2, two in n=3: 23E.

Fourth excited: two in n=1, two in n=3: 20E. Wait, but 20E is lower than 23E. So, perhaps my ordering is wrong.

Wait, this is confusing. Let's list all possible configurations and their energies:

1. All particles in the lowest possible levels: two in n=1, two in n=2. Energy: 2*1E + 2*4E = 10E. Ground state.

2. Next, promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3: two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. Energy: 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E. First excited.

3. Promoting another particle from n=2 to n=3: two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3. Energy: 2E + 0 + 18E = 20E. But this is higher than 15E.

Alternatively, from the first excited state (15E), promoting a particle from n=1 to n=2: but n=2 already has one particle. So, moving one from n=1 to n=2 would result in one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3. Energy: 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. So, 18E is lower than 20E, so this would be the second excited state.

Alternatively, from the ground state, promoting two particles from n=2 to n=3: but that would require two steps. So, the order of states is:

Ground: 10E.

First excited: 15E.

Second excited: 18E.

Third excited: 20E.

Fourth excited: 23E.

Etc.

Therefore, the second excited state is 18E.

But let's confirm this. The key is that when you have multiple ways to promote particles, the one that results in the least energy increase is the next excited state. So, moving a particle from n=1 to n=2 (which increases energy by 3E) is a smaller jump than moving a particle from n=2 to n=3 (which increases by 5E). Therefore, after the first excited state (15E), the next possible state is moving a particle from n=1 to n=2, leading to 18E. Then, moving a particle from n=2 to n=3 would lead to 20E, and so on.

Therefore, the second excited state is 18E.

But let's check if that configuration is allowed. If we have one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3, that's four particles. Each level n=1 and n=3 have one and one particles, but n=2 has two. Since each level can hold two particles (spin up and down), this is allowed. So, that's a valid configuration.

Therefore, the energies are:

Ground state: 10E.

First excited: 15E.

Second excited: 18E.

But let me cross-verify with another approach. The total energy is the sum of the individual energies. For fermions in a 1D box, the filling is done by the lowest energy levels with two particles per level. So, the ground state would have the first two levels filled (n=1 and n=2), each with two particles. Then, the first excited state would be when one particle is promoted from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the next available level (n=3). The second excited state would be when another particle is promoted, but the question is from where.

Alternatively, after promoting one particle to n=3, the next promotion could be either another from n=2 to n=3 (if possible) or from a lower level. But since n=2 now has one particle left, promoting that would leave n=2 empty, but n=3 would have two. Alternatively, promoting a particle from n=1 to n=2. But n=2 can take another particle. So, moving a particle from n=1 to n=2 would result in one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. This is a lower energy increase than moving the remaining n=2 particle to n=3. Therefore, the second excited state is indeed 18E.

Therefore, the answer should be:

Ground state: 10E.

First excited: 15E.

Second excited: 18E.

But let me check if there's another possible configuration. For example, if we have two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. The energy would be 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E. But that's higher than 18E, so not the second excited state.

Alternatively, two in n=1, one in n=3, one in n=4: 2E + 9E + 16E = 27E. Even higher.

Alternatively, one in n=1, one in n=2, two in n=3: 1E + 4E + 18E = 23E. Still higher than 18E.

Therefore, the second excited state is indeed 18E.

Another way to think about this is by considering the possible configurations and their corresponding energies:

1. Ground state: (n=1)^2 (n=2)^2 → 2*1E + 2*4E = 10E.

2. First excited: (n=1)^2 (n=2)^1 (n=3)^1 → 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.

3. Second excited: (n=1)^1 (n=2)^2 (n=3)^1 → 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.

4. Third excited: (n=1)^2 (n=3)^2 → 2E + 18E = 20E.

5. Fourth excited: (n=1)^1 (n=2)^1 (n=3)^2 → 1E + 4E + 18E = 23E.

And so on. Therefore, the order of energies is 10E, 15E, 18E, 20E, 23E, etc. Hence, the second excited state is 18E.

Therefore, the answer is:

Ground state: 10E.

First excited state: 15E.

Second excited state: 18E.

**Final Answer**
The energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are \boxed{10E}, \boxed{15E}, and \boxed{18E} respectively.
