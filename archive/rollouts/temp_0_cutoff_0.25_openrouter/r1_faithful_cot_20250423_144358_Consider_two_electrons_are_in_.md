# Original Question

Consider two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum state. Ignoring there spin angular momentum, the coupled angular momentum state of the 2-electron system is represented by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1, 2, -1>. Here, $l_1, l_2$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of particles 1 and 2 respectively. And, $l, m$ are the total angular momentum quantum number and the corresponding Z component of the 2-electron system respectively. If measurement is made of the orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, what is the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$?

The given coupled state is \(|1, 1, 2, -1\rangle\), which corresponds to two electrons in \(p\)-orbitals (\(l_1 = l_2 = 1\)) coupled to total angular momentum \(L = 2\) and \(m = -1\). To find the joint probability of measuring both \(L_{1z}\) and \(L_{2z}\) as \(-\hbar\) (i.e., \(m_1 = -1\) and \(m_2 = -1\)), we need to express the coupled state in terms of the uncoupled basis states \(|m_1, m_2\rangle\).

The total magnetic quantum number \(m = m_1 + m_2 = -1\). The possible combinations of \(m_1\) and \(m_2\) that satisfy this are \((-1, 0)\) and \((0, -1)\). The state \(|1, -1\rangle \otimes |1, -1\rangle\) corresponds to \(m = -2\), which is part of the \(L = 2, m = -2\) state, not the \(m = -1\) state. 

Using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, the coupled state \(|2, -1\rangle\) is a symmetric combination of the uncoupled states \(|1, -1\rangle|1, 0\rangle\) and \(|1, 0\rangle|1, -1\rangle\) with equal coefficients. Specifically:
\[
|2, -1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |1, -1\rangle|1, 0\rangle + |1, 0\rangle|1, -1\rangle \right)
\]
There is no contribution from \(|1, -1\rangle|1, -1\rangle\) in this state. Therefore, the probability of measuring both \(L_{1z}\) and \(L_{2z}\) as \(-\hbar\) is **zero**.

**Answer:**  
\boxed{0}

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I have this problem here about two electrons in a p orbital angular momentum state. The question is asking for the joint probability of measuring both L_{1z} and L_{2z} as -ħ. The given state is |1,1,2,-1>, which I think means that each electron has orbital angular momentum quantum number l1 = l2 = 1, and the combined state has total angular momentum l = 2 and m = -1. 

First, I need to recall how angular momentum coupling works. Since we're dealing with two particles, their individual angular momenta combine to give a total angular momentum. The state |l1, l2, l, m> is a coupled state, which is a combination of the individual states |l1, m1> and |l2, m2>. The total angular momentum quantum numbers l and m are related to the individual ones by the rules of addition of angular momentum. Specifically, m = m1 + m2, and l can range from |l1 - l2| to l1 + l2 in integer steps. Here, since both l1 and l2 are 1, the possible total l values are 0, 1, 2. But the given state has l = 2, so we're in the maximum total angular momentum state.

Now, the problem is about finding the probability that a measurement of L_{1z} and L_{2z} gives -ħ for both. Since ħ is the unit here, the eigenvalues of L_{1z} and L_{2z} are m1ħ and m2ħ, where m1 and m2 can be -1, 0, +1 for each electron (since they're in p orbitals, l=1). So we need the probability that m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.

But the given state is |1,1,2,-1>, which is a coupled state. To find the probability, I need to express this coupled state in terms of the uncoupled basis states |m1, m2>. Then, the coefficient of the |m1=-1, m2=-1> term squared will give the probability.

So, the key step is to decompose the coupled state |l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1> into the uncoupled basis. This involves using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients relate the coupled states |l1, l2, l, m> to the tensor product states |l1, m1> ⊗ |l2, m2>.

Given that l1 = l2 = 1, and l = 2, m = -1. The possible m1 and m2 that add up to m = -1 are:

m1 + m2 = -1.

Since each m1 and m2 can be -1, 0, +1, the possible pairs (m1, m2) that satisfy this are:

(-1, 0), (0, -1). Wait, but wait, (-1, 0) gives m = -1 + 0 = -1, and (0, -1) gives 0 + (-1) = -1. Also, (-1, 0) and (0, -1). But wait, is there another combination? If m1 = -1 and m2 = 0, that's m = -1. Similarly, m1 = 0 and m2 = -1. But what about m1 = +1 and m2 = -2? But m2 can't be -2 because l2=1, so m2 can only be -1, 0, +1. So only two possible combinations: (-1, 0) and (0, -1). Therefore, the coupled state |2, -1> is a linear combination of the uncoupled states |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

But wait, the problem is asking for the probability of both m1 and m2 being -1. But in the decomposition above, the state |m1=-1, m2=-1> would have m = -2. But our total state has m = -1, so that combination isn't part of the state. Therefore, the coefficient for |m1=-1, m2=-1> in the expansion of |2, -1> is zero. Therefore, the probability should be zero?

But that seems too straightforward. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. The total state is |l=2, m=-1>, which is part of the l=2 multiplet. The possible m values for l=2 are -2, -1, 0, +1, +2. So m=-1 is allowed. But to get m=-1, the individual m1 and m2 must add to -1. The possible pairs (m1, m2) that sum to -1 are (-1, 0) and (0, -1). The pair (-1, -1) sums to -2, which would correspond to the m=-2 state. Therefore, in the state |2, -1>, there is no component with m1=-1 and m2=-1. Therefore, the probability of measuring both L_{1z} and L_{2z} as -ħ (i.e., m1=-1 and m2=-1) is zero.

But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. The coupled state |2, -1> is a combination of the uncoupled states where m1 + m2 = -1. The state |m1=-1, m2=-1> has m1 + m2 = -2, which is part of the l=2, m=-2 state. Therefore, in the expansion of |2, -1>, there is no contribution from |m1=-1, m2=-1>. Therefore, the probability is zero.

But maybe I need to verify this with the actual Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Let me recall the formula for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for two l=1 states coupling to l=2.

The general formula for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is a bit complicated, but for the case of two l=1 particles coupling to L=2, the states can be constructed using ladder operators or by using symmetry.

Alternatively, I can look up the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining two l=1 states. Let me try to recall or derive them.

The highest state |2, 2> is simply the product of |m1=1> and |m2=1>, so |1,1> ⊗ |1,1> = |2,2>.

Then, applying the lowering operator L- = L1- + L2- to both sides to get the other states.

Starting with |2,2> = |1,1>|1,1>.

Apply L- to get |2,1>:

L- |2,2> = (L1- + L2-)|1,1>|1,1> = ħ√(2(2+1) - 2(2-1)) |2,1> = ħ√(6 - 2) |2,1> = ħ√4 |2,1> = 2ħ |2,1>.

On the other hand, applying L1- + L2- to |1,1>|1,1>:

L1- |1,1> = ħ√(1(1+1) - 1(1-1)) |1,0> = ħ√2 |1,0>.

Similarly, L2- |1,1> = ħ√2 |1,0>.

Therefore, (L1- + L2-)|1,1>|1,1> = ħ√2 |1,0>|1,1> + ħ√2 |1,1>|1,0>.

Therefore, equating the two expressions:

2ħ |2,1> = ħ√2 (|1,0>|1,1> + |1,1>|1,0>).

Divide both sides by ħ:

2 |2,1> = √2 (|1,0>|1,1> + |1,1>|1,0>).

Therefore, |2,1> = (1/√2)(|1,0>|1,1> + |1,1>|1,0>).

Similarly, apply L- again to get |2,0>:

L- |2,1> = (L1- + L2-)|2,1> = ħ√(2(2+1) -1(1-1)) |2,0> = ħ√(6 - 0) |2,0> = ħ√6 |2,0>.

On the other hand, applying L1- + L2- to |2,1>:

|2,1> = (1/√2)(|1,0>|1,1> + |1,1>|1,0>).

Apply L-:

(L1- + L2-)(1/√2)(|1,0>|1,1> + |1,1>|1,0>)

= (1/√2)[L1-|1,0>|1,1> + L1-|1,1>|1,0> + L2-|1,0>|1,1> + L2-|1,1>|1,0>]

Compute each term:

L1-|1,0> = ħ√(1(1+1) -0(0-1)) |1,-1> = ħ√2 |1,-1>.

L1-|1,1> = ħ√(1(1+1) -1(1-1)) |1,0> = ħ√2 |1,0>.

Similarly, L2-|1,1> = ħ√2 |1,0>.

L2-|1,0> = ħ√(1(1+1) -0(0-1)) |1,-1> = ħ√2 |1,-1>.

Therefore, substituting back:

= (1/√2)[ ħ√2 |1,-1>|1,1> + ħ√2 |1,0>|1,0> + ħ√2 |1,0>|1,0> + ħ√2 |1,1>|1,-1> ]

Simplify:

= (1/√2) * ħ√2 [ |1,-1>|1,1> + |1,0>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,0> + |1,1>|1,-1> ]

The ħ√2 and 1/√2 cancel out, leaving:

= [ |1,-1>|1,1> + 2|1,0>|1,0> + |1,1>|1,-1> ].

But this should equal ħ√6 |2,0>.

Wait, but we have:

(L1- + L2-)|2,1> = ħ√6 |2,0>.

But the left side after applying L- is [ |1,-1>|1,1> + 2|1,0>|1,0> + |1,1>|1,-1> ].

Therefore, equating:

[ |1,-1>|1,1> + 2|1,0>|1,0> + |1,1>|1,-1> ] = √6 |2,0>.

Therefore, |2,0> = (1/√6)( |1,-1>|1,1> + 2|1,0>|1,0> + |1,1>|1,-1> ).

Continuing this process, apply L- again to get |2,-1>:

L- |2,0> = (L1- + L2-)|2,0> = ħ√(2(2+1) -0(0-1)) |2,-1> = ħ√6 |2,-1>.

On the other hand, applying L1- + L2- to |2,0>:

|2,0> = (1/√6)( |1,-1>|1,1> + 2|1,0>|1,0> + |1,1>|1,-1> ).

Apply L-:

(L1- + L2-)(1/√6)( |1,-1>|1,1> + 2|1,0>|1,0> + |1,1>|1,-1> )

= (1/√6)[ L1-|1,-1>|1,1> + 2L1-|1,0>|1,0> + L1-|1,1>|1,-1> + L2-|1,-1>|1,1> + 2L2-|1,0>|1,0> + L2-|1,1>|1,-1> ]

Compute each term:

L1-|1,-1> = 0 (since m1 cannot go below -1).

L1-|1,0> = ħ√2 |1,-1>.

L1-|1,1> = ħ√2 |1,0>.

Similarly, L2-|1,1> = ħ√2 |1,0>.

L2-|1,0> = ħ√2 |1,-1>.

L2-|1,-1> = 0.

So:

First term: L1-|1,-1>|1,1> = 0.

Second term: 2L1-|1,0>|1,0> = 2 * ħ√2 |1,-1> |1,0>.

Third term: L1-|1,1>|1,-1> = ħ√2 |1,0> |1,-1>.

Fourth term: L2-|1,-1>|1,1> = |1,-1> * L2-|1,1> = |1,-1> * ħ√2 |1,0>.

Fifth term: 2L2-|1,0>|1,0> = 2 * |1,0> * ħ√2 |1,-1>.

Sixth term: L2-|1,1>|1,-1> = L2-|1,1> |1,-1> = ħ√2 |1,0> |1,-1>.

Putting it all together:

= (1/√6)[ 0 + 2ħ√2 |1,-1>|1,0> + ħ√2 |1,0>|1,-1> + ħ√2 |1,-1>|1,0> + 2ħ√2 |1,0>|1,-1> + ħ√2 |1,0>|1,-1> ]

Factor out ħ√2:

= (1/√6) * ħ√2 [ 2 |1,-1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,-1> + |1,-1>|1,0> + 2 |1,0>|1,-1> + |1,0>|1,-1> ]

Combine like terms:

The terms with |1,-1>|1,0> are 2 + 1 = 3.

The terms with |1,0>|1,-1> are 1 + 2 + 1 = 4.

So:

= (1/√6) * ħ√2 [ 3 |1,-1>|1,0> + 4 |1,0>|1,-1> ]

But wait, this seems inconsistent. Wait, let's recount:

Original terms after expanding:

2 |1,-1>|1,0> (from second term)

1 |1,0>|1,-1> (third term)

1 |1,-1>|1,0> (fourth term)

2 |1,0>|1,-1> (fifth term)

1 |1,0>|1,-1> (sixth term)

So total:

For |1,-1>|1,0>: 2 + 1 = 3

For |1,0>|1,-1>: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4

Yes, that's correct.

Therefore:

= (1/√6) * ħ√2 [ 3 |1,-1>|1,0> + 4 |1,0>|1,-1> ]

But wait, this can't be right because the coefficients should be symmetric. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the coefficients.

Wait, let's go back step by step.

After expanding:

First term: 0

Second term: 2L1-|1,0>|1,0> = 2 * ħ√2 |1,-1> |1,0>

Third term: L1-|1,1>|1,-1> = ħ√2 |1,0> |1,-1>

Fourth term: L2-|1,-1>|1,1> = |1,-1> * ħ√2 |1,0>

Fifth term: 2L2-|1,0>|1,0> = 2 * |1,0> * ħ√2 |1,-1>

Sixth term: L2-|1,1>|1,-1> = ħ√2 |1,0> |1,-1>

So:

Second term: 2ħ√2 |1,-1> |1,0>

Third term: ħ√2 |1,0> |1,-1>

Fourth term: ħ√2 |1,-1> |1,0>

Fifth term: 2ħ√2 |1,0> |1,-1>

Sixth term: ħ√2 |1,0> |1,-1>

So combining:

For |1,-1> |1,0>:

Second term: 2ħ√2

Fourth term: ħ√2

Total: 3ħ√2

For |1,0> |1,-1>:

Third term: ħ√2

Fifth term: 2ħ√2

Sixth term: ħ√2

Total: 4ħ√2

Therefore, the total expression is:

(1/√6) * [3ħ√2 |1,-1>|1,0> + 4ħ√2 |1,0>|1,-1> ]

But this should equal ħ√6 |2,-1>.

Therefore:

(1/√6) * ħ√2 [3 |1,-1>|1,0> + 4 |1,0>|1,-1> ] = ħ√6 |2,-1>

Divide both sides by ħ:

(1/√6) * √2 [3 |1,-1>|1,0> + 4 |1,0>|1,-1> ] = √6 |2,-1>

Multiply both sides by √6:

√2 [3 |1,-1>|1,0> + 4 |1,0>|1,-1> ] = 6 |2,-1>

Divide both sides by √2:

[3 |1,-1>|1,0> + 4 |1,0>|1,-1> ] = 6/√2 |2,-1> = 3√2 |2,-1>

Therefore, |2,-1> = (1/3√2)(3 |1,-1>|1,0> + 4 |1,0>|1,-1> )

Wait, that seems messy. Let me check the coefficients again.

Wait, perhaps there's a miscalculation here. Let's go back.

We have:

Left side after applying L-: (1/√6) * ħ√2 [3 |1,-1>|1,0> + 4 |1,0>|1,-1> ]

This should equal ħ√6 |2,-1>.

Therefore:

(1/√6) * √2 [3 |1,-1>|1,0> + 4 |1,0>|1,-1> ] = √6 |2,-1>

Multiply both sides by √6:

√2 [3 |1,-1>|1,0> + 4 |1,0>|1,-1> ] = 6 |2,-1>

Divide both sides by √2:

[3 |1,-1>|1,0> + 4 |1,0>|1,-1> ] = 6/√2 |2,-1> = 3√2 |2,-1>

Therefore, |2,-1> = (1/(3√2)) [3 |1,-1>|1,0> + 4 |1,0>|1,-1> ]

Simplify:

= (3/(3√2)) |1,-1>|1,0> + (4/(3√2)) |1,0>|1,-1>

= (1/√2) |1,-1>|1,0> + (4/(3√2)) |1,0>|1,-1>

Wait, this seems inconsistent because the coefficients should be symmetric. Maybe there's a mistake in the application of the lowering operators.

Alternatively, perhaps I should refer to standard Clebsch-Gordan coefficients tables.

Looking up Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for coupling two l=1 states to L=2, M=-1.

The possible m1 and m2 are (-1,0) and (0,-1). The coefficients can be found using symmetry and orthogonality.

Alternatively, from the formula:

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for l1, l2, m1, m2, L, M is given by:

⟨l1 l2 m1 m2 | L M⟩

For our case, l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1.

The possible m1 and m2 are m1 + m2 = -1, so m1=-1, m2=0 and m1=0, m2=-1.

The coefficients can be calculated using the formula:

⟨1 1 m1 m2 | 2 -1⟩

For m1=-1, m2=0:

The coefficient is sqrt( ( (2 + (-1))! (2 - (-1))! (1 - (-1))! (1 - 0)! ) / ( (2 + 1 + 1 + 1)! ) ) * ... )

Wait, this formula is getting complicated. Alternatively, use the relation that the coefficients for L=2, M=-1 are related to those for L=2, M=1 by symmetry.

From the state |2,1> which is (|1,0>|1,1> + |1,1>|1,0>)/√2, then applying the lowering operator should give |2,0>, and so on. But earlier steps led to a messy result, suggesting a mistake.

Alternatively, recall that the state |2,-1> should be symmetric under exchange of the two particles, just like |2,1> is symmetric. Therefore, the coefficients for |1,-1>|1,0> and |1,0>|1,-1> should be equal. But in our previous calculation, we got coefficients 3 and 4, which are not equal. That suggests an error in the calculation.

Wait, let's try again. When we applied the lowering operator to |2,0>, we should have:

Starting from |2,0> = (1/√6)( |1,-1>|1,1> + 2|1,0>|1,0> + |1,1>|1,-1> )

Applying L- = L1- + L2-:

L-|2,0> = (L1- + L2-)|2,0>

= (1/√6)[ L1-|1,-1>|1,1> + 2L1-|1,0>|1,0> + L1-|1,1>|1,-1> + L2-|1,-1>|1,1> + 2L2-|1,0>|1,0> + L2-|1,1>|1,-1> ]

Now, compute each term:

1. L1-|1,-1>|1,1> = 0 (since L1-|1,-1> = 0)

2. 2L1-|1,0>|1,0> = 2*(ħ√2 |1,-1> ) |1,0> = 2ħ√2 |1,-1>|1,0>

3. L1-|1,1>|1,-1> = (ħ√2 |1,0> ) |1,-1> = ħ√2 |1,0>|1,-1>

4. L2-|1,-1>|1,1> = |1,-1> (L2-|1,1> ) = |1,-1> (ħ√2 |1,0> ) = ħ√2 |1,-1>|1,0>

5. 2L2-|1,0>|1,0> = 2 |1,0> (L2-|1,0> ) = 2 |1,0> (ħ√2 |1,-1> ) = 2ħ√2 |1,0>|1,-1>

6. L2-|1,1>|1,-1> = (L2-|1,1> ) |1,-1> = (ħ√2 |1,0> ) |1,-1> = ħ√2 |1,0>|1,-1>

Now, summing all terms:

Term1: 0

Term2: 2ħ√2 |1,-1>|1,0>

Term3: ħ√2 |1,0>|1,-1>

Term4: ħ√2 |1,-1>|1,0>

Term5: 2ħ√2 |1,0>|1,-1>

Term6: ħ√2 |1,0>|1,-1>

Combine like terms:

For |1,-1>|1,0>:

Term2 + Term4 = 2ħ√2 + ħ√2 = 3ħ√2

For |1,0>|1,-1>:

Term3 + Term5 + Term6 = ħ√2 + 2ħ√2 + ħ√2 = 4ħ√2

So total:

(1/√6) * [3ħ√2 |1,-1>|1,0> + 4ħ√2 |1,0>|1,-1> ]

Factor out ħ√2:

= (1/√6) * ħ√2 [3 |1,-1>|1,0> + 4 |1,0>|1,-1> ]

This should equal ħ√6 |2,-1>

Divide both sides by ħ:

(1/√6) * √2 [3 |1,-1>|1,0> + 4 |1,0>|1,-1> ] = √6 |2,-1>

Multiply both sides by √6:

√2 [3 |1,-1>|1,0> + 4 |1,0>|1,-1> ] = 6 |2,-1>

Divide both sides by √2:

[3 |1,-1>|1,0> + 4 |1,0>|1,-1> ] = 6/√2 |2,-1> = 3√2 |2,-1>

Therefore, |2,-1> = (1/(3√2)) [3 |1,-1>|1,0> + 4 |1,0>|1,-1> ]

Simplify:

= (3/(3√2)) |1,-1>|1,0> + (4/(3√2)) |1,0>|1,-1>

= (1/√2) |1,-1>|1,0> + (4/(3√2)) |1,0>|1,-1>

Wait, this still gives unequal coefficients, which is unexpected because the state |2,-1> should be symmetric under exchange of the two particles. But |1,-1>|1,0> and |1,0>|1,-1> are exchanged under swapping the particles. Therefore, their coefficients should be the same. However, here we have coefficients 1/√2 and 4/(3√2), which are not equal. This suggests that there's a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, maybe the mistake is in the assumption that the state is symmetric. Wait, for two electrons, which are fermions, their total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. However, the problem states to ignore their spin angular momentum. So we're only considering the orbital part. But electrons are fermions, so the total wavefunction (spin + orbital) must be antisymmetric. However, since we're told to ignore spin, perhaps we're just looking at the orbital part, and the question is purely about the angular momentum coupling without considering the antisymmetrization. Therefore, the orbital state can be symmetric or antisymmetric, but since the problem doesn't mention spin, maybe we don't need to worry about it. Therefore, the coupled state |2,-1> is a symmetric combination of the individual states.

But according to our calculation, the coefficients are not symmetric. This must be an error.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is in the application of the lowering operator. Let's try a different approach. The state |2,1> is symmetric, and applying the lowering operator should preserve the symmetry. Let's check:

From |2,1> = (|1,0>|1,1> + |1,1>|1,0>)/√2

Apply L-:

L-|2,1> = (L1- + L2-)|2,1> = (L1- + L2-)(|1,0>|1,1> + |1,1>|1,0>)/√2

= [ (L1-|1,0>)|1,1> + |1,0>(L2-|1,1>) + (L1-|1,1>)|1,0> + |1,1>(L2-|1,0>) ] / √2

= [ (√2 |1,-1>)|1,1> + |1,0>(√2 |1,0>) + (√2 |1,0>)|1,0> + |1,1>(√2 |1,-1>) ] / √2

= √2 [ |1,-1>|1,1> + |1,0>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,0> + |1,1>|1,-1> ] / √2

= [ |1,-1>|1,1> + 2|1,0>|1,0> + |1,1>|1,-1> ]

This should equal √(2(2+1) -1(1-1)) |2,0> = √6 |2,0>

Therefore, |2,0> = (1/√6)( |1,-1>|1,1> + 2|1,0>|1,0> + |1,1>|1,-1> )

Which is symmetric, as expected.

Now apply L- again to get |2,-1>:

L-|2,0> = (L1- + L2-)|2,0> = (1/√6)[ L1-|1,-1>|1,1> + 2L1-|1,0>|1,0> + L1-|1,1>|1,-1> + L2-|1,-1>|1,1> + 2L2-|1,0>|1,0> + L2-|1,1>|1,-1> ]

As before, compute each term:

1. L1-|1,-1>|1,1> = 0

2. 2L1-|1,0>|1,0> = 2√2 |1,-1>|1,0>

3. L1-|1,1>|1,-1> = √2 |1,0>|1,-1>

4. L2-|1,-1>|1,1> = √2 |1,-1>|1,0>

5. 2L2-|1,0>|1,0> = 2√2 |1,0>|1,-1>

6. L2-|1,1>|1,-1> = √2 |1,0>|1,-1>

Putting it all together:

= (1/√6)[ 0 + 2√2 |1,-1>|1,0> + √2 |1,0>|1,-1> + √2 |1,-1>|1,0> + 2√2 |1,0>|1,-1> + √2 |1,0>|1,-1> ]

Combine like terms:

For |1,-1>|1,0>:

2√2 + √2 = 3√2

For |1,0>|1,-1>:

√2 + 2√2 + √2 = 4√2

So:

= (1/√6)(3√2 |1,-1>|1,0> + 4√2 |1,0>|1,-1> )

Factor out √2:

= (1/√6)√2 (3 |1,-1>|1,0> + 4 |1,0>|1,-1> )

= √(2/6) (3 |1,-1>|1,0> + 4 |1,0>|1,-1> )

= √(1/3) (3 |1,-1>|1,0> + 4 |1,0>|1,-1> )

= (3/√3) |1,-1>|1,0> + (4/√3) |1,0>|1,-1>

= √3 |1,-1>|1,0> + (4/√3) |1,0>|1,-1>

But this should equal √(2(2+1) - (-1)(-1-1)) |2,-1> = √(6 - 2) |2,-1> = √4 |2,-1> = 2 |2,-1>

Therefore:

√3 |1,-1>|1,0> + (4/√3) |1,0>|1,-1> = 2 |2,-1>

Solve for |2,-1>:

|2,-1> = (√3/2) |1,-1>|1,0> + (4/(2√3)) |1,0>|1,-1>

= (√3/2) |1,-1>|1,0> + (2/√3) |1,0>|1,-1>

But this still doesn't look symmetric. There must be a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficients are correct but I'm missing something.

Wait, let's check the normalization. The state |2,-1> should be normalized. Let's compute the square of the coefficients:

(√3/2)^2 + (2/√3)^2 = (3/4) + (4/3) = (9/12) + (16/12) = 25/12 ≈ 2.083, which is greater than 1. This is not possible, so there must be an error.

This indicates that there's a mistake in the calculation. The correct coefficients should satisfy the normalization condition. Let's try to find the correct coefficients.

Alternatively, refer to standard Clebsch-Gordan tables. According to standard tables, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for coupling two l=1 states to L=2, M=-1 are:

⟨1 1 -1 0 | 2 -1⟩ = sqrt(1/2)

⟨1 1 0 -1 | 2 -1⟩ = sqrt(1/2)

But wait, that can't be right because the sum of the squares should be 1. If both coefficients are sqrt(1/2), then the total is 1/2 + 1/2 = 1, which is correct. But according to our previous calculation, we had unequal coefficients. This suggests that the correct coefficients are both 1/√2, making the state symmetric.

But according to the table, the coefficients are equal. Therefore, the state |2,-1> is:

|2,-1> = (1/√2)( |1,-1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,-1> )

But this contradicts our earlier calculation. Where is the mistake?

Ah, I think the mistake is in the application of the lowering operator. Let's try again, but this time correctly.

Starting from |2,0> = (1/√6)( |1,-1>|1,1> + 2|1,0>|1,0> + |1,1>|1,-1> )

Apply L- = L1- + L2-:

L-|2,0> = (L1- + L2-)|2,0> = (1/√6)[ L1-|1,-1>|1,1> + 2L1-|1,0>|1,0> + L1-|1,1>|1,-1> + L2-|1,-1>|1,1> + 2L2-|1,0>|1,0> + L2-|1,1>|1,-1> ]

Compute each term:

1. L1-|1,-1>|1,1> = 0

2. 2L1-|1,0>|1,0> = 2*(√2 |1,-1> ) |1,0> = 2√2 |1,-1>|1,0>

3. L1-|1,1>|1,-1> = √2 |1,0> |1,-1>

4. L2-|1,-1>|1,1> = |1,-1> * √2 |1,0> = √2 |1,-1>|1,0>

5. 2L2-|1,0>|1,0> = 2*|1,0> * √2 |1,-1> = 2√2 |1,0>|1,-1>

6. L2-|1,1>|1,-1> = √2 |1,0> |1,-1>

Now, summing all terms:

= (1/√6)[ 0 + 2√2 |1,-1>|1,0> + √2 |1,0>|1,-1> + √2 |1,-1>|1,0> + 2√2 |1,0>|1,-1> + √2 |1,0>|1,-1> ]

Combine like terms:

For |1,-1>|1,0>:

2√2 + √2 = 3√2

For |1,0>|1,-1>:

√2 + 2√2 + √2 = 4√2

So:

= (1/√6)(3√2 |1,-1>|1,0> + 4√2 |1,0>|1,-1> )

Factor out √2:

= (1/√6)√2 (3 |1,-1>|1,0> + 4 |1,0>|1,-1> )

= √(2/6) (3 |1,-1>|1,0> + 4 |1,0>|1,-1> )

= √(1/3) (3 |1,-1>|1,0> + 4 |1,0>|1,-1> )

= (3/√3) |1,-1>|1,0> + (4/√3) |1,0>|1,-1>

= √3 |1,-1>|1,0> + (4/√3) |1,0>|1,-1>

But this should equal √(2(2+1) - (-1)(-1-1)) |2,-1> = √(6 - 2) |2,-1> = √4 |2,-1> = 2 |2,-1>

Therefore:

√3 |1,-1>|1,0> + (4/√3) |1,0>|1,-1> = 2 |2,-1>

Divide both sides by 2:

(√3/2) |1,-1>|1,0> + (4/(2√3)) |1,0>|1,-1> = |2,-1>

Simplify coefficients:

√3/2 = (√3)/2 ≈ 0.866

4/(2√3) = 2/√3 ≈ 1.1547

But these coefficients are not equal, which contradicts the expectation from symmetry. However, according to standard Clebsch-Gordan tables, the coefficients should be equal. This suggests that there's a mistake in the application of the lowering operator.

Alternatively, perhaps the standard table is correct, and our calculation is wrong. Let's check a reliable source. According to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for two l=1 states:

For L=2, M=-1, the coefficients are:

⟨1 1 -1 0 | 2 -1⟩ = sqrt(1/2)

⟨1 1 0 -1 | 2 -1⟩ = sqrt(1/2)

Therefore, the state |2,-1> is:

|2,-1> = (1/√2)( |1,-1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,-1> )

This makes sense because the state should be symmetric under exchange of the two particles. Therefore, our previous calculation must have an error.

Where did we go wrong? Let's see. The problem arises when applying the lowering operator to |2,0>. The result we obtained didn't match the symmetric state. This suggests that the error is in the calculation steps. However, following the standard procedure, the coefficients should indeed be symmetric. Therefore, the correct decomposition of |2,-1> is symmetric, with coefficients 1/√2 for both |1,-1>|1,0> and |1,0>|1,-1>.

Therefore, the correct expression is:

|2,-1> = (1/√2)( |1,-1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,-1> )

This means that in the state |2,-1>, there are no components where both m1 and m2 are -1. Therefore, the probability of measuring both L_{1z} and L_{2z} as -ħ is zero.

But wait, according to the Clebsch-Gordan table, that's correct. The state |2,-1> is a combination of |1,-1>|1,0> and |1,0>|1,-1>, with equal coefficients. Therefore, the probability of both m1 and m2 being -1 is zero.

Therefore, the joint probability is zero.

But let's confirm this with another approach. The state |2,-1> is part of the l=2 multiplet, which is symmetric. The possible m values are from -2 to +2. The state with m=-2 would be |1,-1>|1,-1>, which is the only combination that gives m=-2. Therefore, the state |2,-2> = |1,-1>|1,-1>.

Then, the state |2,-1> is obtained by applying the raising operator to |2,-2>, but actually, it's obtained by applying the lowering operator to higher states. Anyway, the key point is that |2,-1> does not include the |1,-1>|1,-1> component.

Therefore, the probability is indeed zero.

But to be thorough, let's consider the full expansion. The total Hilbert space for two l=1 particles is 3x3=9 dimensional. The coupled states are:

- One l=2 multiplet (dimension 5)
- One l=1 multiplet (dimension 3)
- One l=0 multiplet (dimension 1)

The state |1,-1>|1,-1> is part of the l=2 multiplet as the |2,-2> state. The |2,-1> state is orthogonal to |2,-2> and is a combination of |1,-1>|1,0> and |1,0>|1,-1>.

Therefore, the answer is that the joint probability is zero.

But wait, the problem says "ignoring their spin angular momentum". Does that affect anything? Probably not, because we're only asked about the orbital angular momentum. The spin is being ignored, so we don't have to worry about antisymmetrizing the total wavefunction. Therefore, the orbital state can be symmetric or antisymmetric, but in this case, the coupled state |2,-1> is symmetric, and does not include the |1,-1>|1,-1> component.

Therefore, the probability is zero.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I have this problem here about two electrons in a p orbital angular momentum state. The question is asking for the joint probability of measuring both L_{1z} and L_{2z} as -ħ. The given state is |1,1,2,-1>, which I think means that each electron has orbital angular momentum quantum number l1 = l2 = 1, and the combined state has total angular momentum l = 2 and m = -1. 

First, I need to recall how angular momentum coupling works. Since we're dealing with two particles, their individual angular momenta combine to give a total angular momentum. The state |l1, l2, l, m> is a coupled state, which is a combination of the individual states |l1, m1> and |l2, m2>. The total angular momentum quantum numbers l and m are related to the individual ones by the rules of addition of angular momentum. Specifically, m = m1 + m2, and l can range from |l1 - l2| to l1 + l2 in integer steps. Here, since both l1 and l2 are 1, the possible total l values are 0, 1, 2. But the given state has l = 2, so we're in the maximum total angular momentum state.

Now, the problem is about finding the probability that a measurement of L_{1z} and L_{2z} gives -ħ for both. Since ħ is the unit here, the eigenvalues of L_{1z} and L_{2z} are m1ħ and m2ħ, where m1 and m2 can be -1, 0, +1 for each electron (since they're in p orbitals, l=1). So we need the probability that m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.

But the given state is |1,1,2,-1>, which is a coupled state. To find the probability, I need to express this coupled state in terms of the uncoupled basis states |m1, m2>. Then, the coefficient of the |m1=-1, m2=-1> term squared will give the probability.

So, the key step is to decompose the coupled state |l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1> into the uncoupled basis. This involves using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients relate the coupled states |l1, l2, l, m> to the tensor product states |l1, m1> ⊗ |l2, m2>.

Given that l1 = l2 = 1, and l = 2, m = -1. The possible m1 and m2 that add up to m = -1 are:

m1 + m2 = -1.

Since each m1 and m2 can be -1, 0, +1, the possible pairs (m1, m2) that satisfy this are:

(-1, 0), (0, -1). Wait, but wait, (-1, 0) gives m = -1 + 0 = -1, and (0, -1) gives 0 + (-1) = -1. Also, (-1, 0) and (0, -1). But wait, is there another combination? If m1 = -1 and m2 = 0, that's m = -1. Similarly, m1 = 0 and m2 = -1. But what about m1 = +1 and m2 = -2? But m2 can't be -2 because l2=1, so m2 can only be -1, 0, +1. So only two possible combinations: (-1, 0) and (0, -1). Therefore, the coupled state |2, -1> is a linear combination of the uncoupled states |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

But wait, the problem is asking for the probability of both m1 and m2 being -1. But in the decomposition above, the state |m1=-1, m2=-1> would have m = -2. But our total state has m = -1, so that combination isn't part of the state. Therefore, the coefficient for |m1=-1, m2=-1> in the expansion of |2, -1> is zero. Therefore, the probability should be zero?

But that seems too straightforward. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. The total state is |l=2, m=-1>, which is part of the l=2 multiplet. The possible m values for l=2 are -2, -1, 0, +1, +2. So m=-1 is allowed. But to get m=-1, the individual m1 and m2 must add to -1. The possible pairs (m1, m2) that sum to -1 are (-1, 0) and (0, -1). The pair (-1, -1) sums to -2, which would correspond to the m=-2 state. Therefore, in the state |2, -1>, there is no component with m1=-1 and m2=-1. Therefore, the probability of measuring both L_{1z} and L_{2z} as -ħ (i.e., m1=-1 and m2=-1) is zero.

But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. The coupled state |2, -1> is a combination of the uncoupled states where m1 + m2 = -1. The state |m1=-1, m2=-1> has m1 + m2 = -2, which is part of the l=2, m=-2 state. Therefore, in the expansion of |2, -1>, there is no contribution from |m1=-1, m2=-1>. Therefore, the probability is zero.

But maybe I need to verify this with the actual Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Let me recall the formula for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for two l=1 states coupling to l=2.

The general formula for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is a bit complicated, but for the case of two l=1 particles coupling to L=2, the states can be constructed using ladder operators or by using symmetry.

Alternatively, I can look up the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining two l=1 states. Let me try to recall or derive them.

The highest state |2, 2> is simply the product of |m1=1> and |m2=1>, so |1,1> ⊗ |1,1> = |2,2>.

Then, applying the lowering operator L- = L1- + L2- to both sides to get the other states.

Starting with |2,2> = |1,1>|1,1>.

Apply L- to get |2,1>:

L- |2,2> = (L1- + L2-)|1,1>|1,1> = ħ√(2(2+1) - 2(2-1)) |2,1> = ħ√(6 - 2) |2,1> = ħ√4 |2,1> = 2ħ |2,1>.

On the other hand, applying L1- + L2- to |1,1>|1,1>:

L1- |1,1> = ħ√(1(1+1) - 1(1-1)) |1,0> = ħ√2 |1,0>.

Similarly, L2- |1,1> = ħ√2 |1,0>.

Therefore, (L1- + L2-)|1,1>|1,1> = ħ√2 |1,0>|1,1> + ħ√2 |1,1>|1,0>.

Therefore, equating the two expressions:

2ħ |2,1> = ħ√2 (|1,0>|1,1> + |1,1>|1,0>).

Divide both sides by ħ:

2 |2,1> = √2 (|1,0>|1,1> + |1,1>|1,0>).

Therefore, |2,1> = (1/√2)(|1,0>|1,1> + |1,1>|1,0>).

Similarly, apply L- again to get |2,0>:

L- |2,1> = (L1- + L2-)|2,1> = ħ√(2(2+1) -1(1-1)) |2,0> = ħ√(6 - 0) |2,0> = ħ√6 |2,0>.

On the other hand, applying L1- + L2- to |2,1>:

|2,1> = (1/√2)(|1,0>|1,1> + |1,1>|1,0>).

Apply L-:

(L1- + L2-)(1/√2)(|1,0>|1,1> + |1,1>|1,0>)

= (1/√2)[L1-|1,0>|1,1> + L1-|1,1>|1,0> + L2-|1,0>|1,1> + L2-|1,1>|1,0>]

Compute each term:

L1-|1,0> = ħ√(1(1+1) -0(0-1)) |1,-1> = ħ√2 |1,-1>.

L1-|1,1> = ħ√(1(1+1)

# Anthropic completion

Alright, so I'm tackling this problem about two electrons in a p orbital angular momentum state. The question asks for the joint probability of measuring both L_{1z} and L_{2z} as -ħ. The state given is |1,1,2,-1>, which I believe means that each electron has orbital angular momentum quantum number l1 = l2 = 1, and the combined state has total angular momentum l = 2 and m = -1.

To approach this, I need to understand how angular momentum coupling works. With two particles, their individual angular momenta combine to form a total angular momentum. The state |l1, l2, l, m> is a coupled state that combines the individual states |l1, m1> and |l2, m2>. The total quantum numbers l and m relate to the individual ones through angular momentum addition rules. Specifically, m = m1 + m2, and l can range from |l1 - l2| to l1 + l2 in integer steps. Since both l1 and l2 are 1 here, the possible total l values are 0, 1, 2. Our given state has l = 2, placing us in the maximum total angular momentum state.

The problem asks for the probability that measuring L_{1z} and L_{2z} both yields -ħ. The eigenvalues of L_{1z} and L_{2z} are m1ħ and m2ħ, where m1 and m2 can be -1, 0, +1 for each electron (since we're dealing with p orbitals where l=1). So I need to find the probability that m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.

The given state |1,1,2,-1> is a coupled state. To find this probability, I need to express it in terms of uncoupled basis states |m1, m2>. The squared coefficient of the |m1=-1, m2=-1> term will give me the probability.

The key step is decomposing the coupled state |l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1> into the uncoupled basis using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. These coefficients relate the coupled states |l1, l2, l, m> to the tensor product states |l1, m1> ⊗ |l2, m2>.

For our case with l1 = l2 = 1, l = 2, m = -1, the possible m1 and m2 combinations that satisfy m1 + m2 = -1 are:
(-1, 0) and (0, -1)

The combination (1, -2) isn't valid because m2 can only be -1, 0, or +1 for l2=1. Similarly, the combination (-1, -1) gives m = -2, not -1.

Since the total state has m = -1, and m1 + m2 must equal m, the state |m1=-1, m2=-1> (which has m = -2) isn't part of our coupled state |2, -1>. Therefore, the coefficient for |m1=-1, m2=-1> in the expansion of |2, -1> is zero, making the probability zero.

To verify this, I could calculate the exact Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining two l=1 states. Starting with |2,2> = |1,1>|1,1>, and applying lowering operators, I can derive that |2,1> = (1/√2)(|1,0>|1,1> + |1,1>|1,0>). Continuing with this approach would confirm that the state |2,-1> has no component with both m1 and m2 equal to -1.

Therefore, the probability of measuring both L_{1z} and L_{2z} as -ħ in the state |1,1,2,-1> is zero.

# OpenAI completion

Sure, I'll rephrase the text for you:

Alright, I have a problem here involving two electrons in a p orbital angular momentum state. The task is to find the joint probability of measuring both L_{1z} and L_{2z} as -ħ. The given state is |1,1,2,-1>, suggesting each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l1 = l2 = 1, with the combined state having a total angular momentum l = 2 and m = -1.

First, I need to recall how angular momentum coupling functions. In the case of two particles, their individual angular momenta combine to produce a total angular momentum. The state |l1, l2, l, m> is a coupled state, which can be expressed as a combination of the individual states |l1, m1> and |l2, m2>. The total angular momentum quantum numbers l and m are related to the individual ones by the addition rules: m = m1 + m2, and l ranges from |l1 - l2| to l1 + l2 in integer steps. Given that both l1 and l2 are 1, the potential total l values are 0, 1, 2. Since the given state has l = 2, we are dealing with the maximum total angular momentum state.

The next step is to find the probability that a measurement of L_{1z} and L_{2z} yields -ħ for both. In this scenario, m1 and m2 can have the values -1, 0, +1 since they are in p orbitals, with l=1. So, we're looking for the probability of m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.

The given state is |1,1,2,-1>, a coupled state, and to find the probability, I must convert this coupled state into the uncoupled basis states |m1, m2>. The squared coefficient of |m1=-1, m2=-1> will provide the probability.

To achieve this, I need to decompose the coupled state |l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1> into uncoupled basis states, which entails employing Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. These coefficients bridge coupled states |l1, l2, l, m> and tensor product states |l1, m1> ⊗ |l2, m2>.

Given l1 = l2 = 1 and l = 2, m = -1, the viable m1 and m2 combinations that sum to m = -1 are:

m1 + m2 = -1.

With m1 and m2 being able to take values -1, 0, +1, the combinations (m1, m2) fulfilling this are:

(-1, 0) and (0, -1).

However, (-1, -1) totals m = -2, not valid for m = -1. Thus, the state |2, -1> is a mix of the uncoupled states |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>. Consequently, there is no coefficient for |m1=-1, m2=-1> in the expansion of |2, -1>. Hence, the probability is zero.

This result appears straightforward, but let's examine it closely.

The coupled state |l=2, m=-1> belongs to the l=2 multiplet, with possible m values of -2, -1, 0, +1, +2. To achieve m=-1, m1 and m2 must sum to -1. Combinations (m1, m2) rendering this are (-1, 0) and (0, -1). Since (-1, -1) results in -2, it isn't part of the m=-1 state. As such, in the state |2, -1>, there isn't any contribution from |m1=-1, m2=-1>, confirming the zero probability.

Verification with Clebsch-Gordan coefficients might cement this conclusion. Typically, these coefficients relate l=1 states coupling to L=2.

The formula for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is complicated, but for two l=1 states combining to l=2, constructs can be derived using ladder operators or symmetry.

Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for two l=1 states state that |2, 2> = |1,1> ⊗ |1,1>.

Applying the lowering operator L- = L1- + L2-, starting with |2,2> = |1,1>|1,1> to deduce other states:
- L- |2,2> = (L1- + L2-) |1,1>|1,1> results in-ħ√(2 * 3 - 2 * 1)|2,1> = ħ2 |2,1>.
- L1- and L2- applied to |1,1> provide |1,0>.

Combining these findings, |2,1> = (1/√2)(|1,0>|1,1> + |1,1>|1,0>).

Extending these computations gives:

Subsequent applications yield decompositions, further confirming that components like |m1=-1, m2=-1> aren't present in the m=-1 state, supporting the zero probability conclusion.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

Given two electrons in a p orbital angular momentum state, we need to find the joint probability of measuring both \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) as \( -\hbar \). The given state is \( |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle \), where \( l_1 = 1 \), \( l_2 = 1 \), \( l = 2 \), and \( m = -1 \).

1. **Understanding the Coupled State**:
   - The coupled state \( |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle \) represents the total angular momentum state with \( l = 2 \) and \( m = -1 \).
   - The eigenvalues \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) for \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) must satisfy \( m_1 + m_2 = -1 \).

2. **Possible Combinations of \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \)**:
   - For \( m = -1 \), the possible pairs \((m_1, m_2)\) are \((-1, 0)\) and \((0, -1)\).
   - The pair \((-1, -1)\) would result in \( m = -2 \), which is not part of the \( m = -1 \) state.

3. **Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients**:
   - The state \( |2, -1\rangle \) is derived using the lowering operator and is found to be a combination of \( |1, -1\rangle \otimes |1, 0\rangle \) and \( |1, 0\rangle \otimes |1, -1\rangle \).
   - The expansion of \( |2, -1\rangle \) in the uncoupled basis is \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1, -1\rangle |1, 0\rangle + |1, 0\rangle |1, -1\rangle) \).

4. **Probability Calculation**:
   - The state \( |1, -1\rangle \otimes |1, -1\rangle \) (which corresponds to \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \)) is not part of the \( |2, -1\rangle \) state.
   - Therefore, the coefficient for \( |1, -1\rangle \otimes |1, -1\rangle \) in the expansion is zero.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The joint probability of measuring both \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) as \( -\hbar \) is zero.

-1(1-1)) |1,0> = ħ√2 |1,0>.

Similarly, L2-|1,1> = ħ√2 |1,0>, and L2-|1,0> = ħ√2 |1,-1>.

Therefore, substituting:

= (1/√2)[ ħ√2 |1,-1>|1,1> + ħ√2 |1,0>|1,0> + ħ√2 |1,0>|1,0> + ħ√2 |1,1>|1,-1> ]

Simplify:

= (1/√2) * ħ√2 [ |1,-1>|1,1> + |1,0>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,0> + |1,1>|1,-1> ]

The ħ√2 and 1/√2 cancel out, leaving:

[ |1,-1>|1,1> + 2|1,0>|1,0> + |1,1>|1,-1> ]

But this should equal ħ√6 |2,0>.

Wait, but we have:

(L- |2,1>) = [ |1,-1>|1,1> + 2|1,0>|1,0> + |1,1>|1,-1> ] = ħ√6 |2,0>.

Therefore, |2,0> = (1/√6)( |1,-1>|1,1> + 2|1,0>|1,0> + |1,1>|1,-1> )

Continuing this process, apply L- again to get |2,-1>:

L- |2,0> = (L1- + L2-)|2,0> = ħ√(2(2+1) -0(0-1)) |2,-1> = ħ√6 |2,-1>.

On the other hand, applying L1- + L2- to |2,0>:

|2,0> = (1/√6)( |1,-1>|1,1> + 2|1,0>|1,0> + |1,1>|1,-1> )

Apply L-:

(L1- + L2-)|2,0> = (1/√6)[ L1-|1,-1>|1,1> + 2L1-|1,0>|1,0> + L1-|1,1>|1,-1> + L2-|1,-1>|1,1> + 2L2-|1,0>|1,0> + L2-|1,1>|1,-1> ]

Compute each term:

L1-|1,-1> = 0 (since m1 cannot go below -1)

L1-|1,0> = ħ√2 |1,-1>

L1-|1,1> = ħ√2 |1,0>

Similarly, L2-|1,1> = ħ√2 |1,0>

L2-|1,0> = ħ√2 |1,-1>

L2-|1,-1> = 0

So substituting:

= (1/√6)[ 0 + 2*ħ√2 |1,-1>|1,0> + ħ√2 |1,0>|1,-1> + ħ√2 |1,-1>|1,0> + 2*ħ√2 |1,0>|1,-1> + 0 ]

Simplify:

= (1/√6)[ 2ħ√2 |1,-1>|1,0> + ħ√2 |1,0>|1,-1> + ħ√2 |1,-1>|1,0> + 2ħ√2 |1,0>|1,-1> ]

Combine like terms:

For |1,-1>|1,0>:

2ħ√2 + ħ√2 = 3ħ√2

For |1,0>|1,-1>:

ħ√2 + 2ħ√2 = 3ħ√2

Therefore:

= (1/√6)( 3ħ√2 |1,-1>|1,0> + 3ħ√2 |1,0>|1,-1> )

Factor out 3ħ√2:

= (3ħ√2 / √6)( |1,-1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,-1> )

Simplify the constants:

3ħ√2 / √6 = 3ħ (√2 / √6) = 3ħ (1/√3) = ħ√3 * √3 / √3 = ħ√3? Wait, let's compute:

√2 / √6 = √(2/6) = √(1/3) = 1/√3

Therefore, 3ħ√2 / √6 = 3ħ * (1/√3) = ħ * 3 / √3 = ħ * √3 * √3 / √3 = ħ√3

Wait, 3 / √3 = √3, so yes, 3ħ / √3 = ħ√3.

Therefore, the expression becomes:

ħ√3 ( |1,-1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,-1> )

But we also have that L- |2,0> = ħ√6 |2,-1>

Therefore:

ħ√3 ( |1,-1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,-1> ) = ħ√6 |2,-1>

Divide both sides by ħ:

√3 ( |1,-1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,-1> ) = √6 |2,-1>

Divide both sides by √3:

|1,-1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,-1> = √(6/3) |2,-1> = √2 |2,-1>

Therefore, solving for |2,-1>:

|2,-1> = (1/√2)( |1,-1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,-1> )

So the coupled state |2,-1> is an equal superposition of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>, each with coefficient 1/√2. Therefore, when we expand |2,-1> in the uncoupled basis, there are no terms with m1=-1 and m2=-1. Therefore, the amplitude for that particular state is zero, and hence the probability is zero.

Therefore, the joint probability of measuring both L_{1z} and L_{2z} as -ħ is zero.

But wait, let me just confirm once more. The state |2,-1> is a combination of | -1, 0 > and | 0, -1 >. The state | -1, -1 > is part of the l=2, m=-2 state, which is a different state. Therefore, in the expansion of |2,-1>, there is no | -1, -1 > component. Therefore, the probability is indeed zero.

Alternatively, if I think about the possible combinations, for two p electrons, the possible total angular momentum states are l=2, 1, 0. For l=2, the possible m values are -2, -1, 0, 1, 2. The m=-2 state is | -1, -1 >. The m=-1 state is a combination of | -1, 0 > and | 0, -1 >. Therefore, the state |2,-1> does not include | -1, -1 >. Therefore, the probability is zero.

Therefore, the answer should be 0. But let me check if there's another way to approach this.

Alternatively, since the total state is symmetric (since l=2 is symmetric under exchange for two l=1 particles?), but wait, actually, the symmetry of the orbital state depends on the combined angular momentum.

Therefore, given that, the expansion of |2,-1> in the uncoupled basis does not include the | -1, -1 > term, so the probability is zero.

Therefore, the answer is 0. So the joint probability is zero.

**Final Answer**
The joint probability is \boxed{0}.

The joint probability of measuring both \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) as \(-\hbar\) in the coupled state \(|1,1,2,-1\rangle\) is **0**.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understand the State:** The given state \(|1,1,2,-1\rangle\) represents two electrons (each with \(l_1 = l_2 = 1\)) coupled to total angular momentum \(l = 2\) and \(m = -1\).

2. **Angular Momentum Coupling:** The total \(m = m_1 + m_2\). For \(m = -1\), possible \((m_1, m_2)\) pairs are \((-1, 0)\) and \((0, -1)\). The pair \((-1, -1)\) sums to \(m = -2\), which is not part of the \(l = 2, m = -1\) state.

3. **Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients:** The coupled state \(|2, -1\rangle\) is a linear combination of the uncoupled states \(|m_1, m_2\rangle\) that satisfy \(m_1 + m_2 = -1\). The coefficients for \((-1, 0)\) and \((0, -1)\) are non-zero, but the coefficient for \((-1, -1)\) is zero.

4. **Probability Calculation:** Since the \(|m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle\) term does not contribute to \(|2, -1\rangle\), the probability of measuring both \(L_{1z} = -\hbar\) and \(L_{2z} = -\hbar\) is \(0\).

**Answer:** \(\boxed{0}\)

Given two electrons in a p orbital angular momentum state, we need to find the joint probability of measuring both \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) as \( -\hbar \). The given state is \( |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle \), where \( l_1 = 1 \), \( l_2 = 1 \), \( l = 2 \), and \( m = -1 \).

1. **Understanding the Coupled State**:
   - The coupled state \( |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle \) represents the total angular momentum state with \( l = 2 \) and \( m = -1 \).
   - The possible values for \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) (the z-components of the individual angular momenta) must sum to \( m = -1 \).

2. **Possible Combinations of \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \)**:
   - For \( m = -1 \), the valid combinations of \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are \( (-1, 0) \) and \( (0, -1) \).
   - The combination \( (-1, -1) \) sums to \( -2 \), which is not valid for \( m = -1 \).

3. **Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients**:
   - The coupled state \( |2, -1\rangle \) is decomposed into the uncoupled basis states using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.
   - The decomposition shows that \( |2, -1\rangle \) is a combination of \( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0\rangle \) and \( |m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1\rangle \).

4. **Probability Calculation**:
   - The state \( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle \) does not contribute to the coupled state \( |2, -1\rangle \).
   - Therefore, the coefficient for \( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle \) in the expansion is zero.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The joint probability of measuring \( L_{1z} = -\hbar \) and \( L_{2z} = -\hbar \) is zero.

\[
\boxed{0}
\]

Alternatively, the state |2, -1> can be obtained by lowering |2,1> twice. Each lowering operation introduces combinations of m1 and m2 that sum to the new m. Starting from |2,1> as (1/√2)(|1,0>|1,1> + |1,1>|1,0>), lowering once gives |2,0> with components involving m1 and m2 summing to 0, and lowering again gives |2,-1> with components summing to -1. Each step doesn't introduce (-1, -1) because that would require lowering both m1 and m2 twice, but the lowering operator only acts once each time. Therefore, the components in |2,-1> are indeed (-1,0) and (0,-1), not (-1,-1).

Therefore, the joint probability of both electrons having m1 = -1 and m2 = -1 is zero.

**Final Answer**
The joint probability is \boxed{0}.
