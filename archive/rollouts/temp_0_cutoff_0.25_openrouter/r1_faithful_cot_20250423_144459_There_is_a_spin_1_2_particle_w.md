The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment \(\mu = \gamma S_z\) initially aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. When the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude \(B\), we need to determine the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s magnetic moment.

1. **Initial State and Hamiltonian Change**:
   - The initial state is \(|+z\rangle\), an eigenstate of \(S_z\).
   - The Hamiltonian changes from \(H_{\text{initial}} = -\gamma B S_z\) to \(H_{\text{final}} = -\gamma B S_y\).

2. **Time Evolution**:
   - The eigenstates of \(S_y\) are \(|+y\rangle\) and \(|-y\rangle\), which can be expressed in the \(S_z\) basis:
     \[
     |+y\rangle = \frac{|+z\rangle + i|-z\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-y\rangle = \frac{|+z\rangle - i|-z\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}
     \]
   - The initial state \(|+z\rangle\) is expressed in the \(S_y\) basis:
     \[
     |+z\rangle = \frac{|+y\rangle + |-y\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}
     \]

3. **Time Evolution Under \(H_{\text{final}}\)**:
   - The time evolution operator \(U(t) = \exp(-i H t / \hbar)\) with \(H = -\gamma B S_y\) leads to:
     \[
     |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ \exp\left(i \frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right) |+y\rangle + \exp\left(-i \frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right) |-y\rangle \right]
     \]
   - Converting back to the \(S_z\) basis:
     \[
     |\psi(t)\rangle = \cos\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right) |+z\rangle - \sin\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right) |-z\rangle
     \]

4. **Expectation Value of \(S_z\)**:
   - The expectation value \(\langle S_z \rangle(t)\) is calculated as:
     \[
     \langle S_z \rangle(t) = \left( \cos^2\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right) - \sin^2\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right) \right) \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t)
     \]
   - The oscillation frequency of \(\langle S_z \rangle(t)\) is determined by the argument of the cosine function, which is \(\gamma B t\).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s magnetic moment is the angular frequency \(\gamma B\).

\[
\boxed{\gamma B}
\]

Okay, so I have this problem about a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is initially aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one in the +Y direction is turned on, both with the same magnitude B. The question is asking for the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. Hmm, let me try to work through this step by step.

First, I remember that the magnetic moment mu is related to the spin operator. For a spin-1/2 particle, the magnetic moment operator is given by mu = gamma * S, where gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, and S is the spin operator. In this case, since the initial magnetic field is along the +Z direction, the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with Sz. So initially, the system is in an eigenstate of Sz, right? Let me confirm: if the magnetic field is in +Z, the particle's spin will align with the field, so the initial state is either spin-up or spin-down along Z. But since it's aligned, I think it's spin-up. Wait, the problem says "aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction," so that would be the spin-up state, |+z⟩.

Then, the magnetic field is suddenly turned off, and another one is turned on along +Y. So the Hamiltonian changes abruptly from being proportional to Sz to being proportional to Sy. The magnitude of the magnetic field is the same, so the Hamiltonian before was H_initial = -mu · B = -gamma * B * Sz (since the field is along Z), and after the switch, it's H_final = -gamma * B * Sy. Wait, but the problem says both fields have the same magnitude B. So the initial Hamiltonian is H_initial = -gamma * B * S_z, and after switching, it's H_final = -gamma * B * S_y. But when the field is turned off, does that mean H becomes zero? Wait, the problem says "the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction; both fields have the same magnitude, B." Wait, maybe I misread. It says "both fields have the same magnitude, B." So the original field in Z has magnitude B, and the new field in Y also has magnitude B. So the initial Hamiltonian is H_initial = -gamma * B * S_z, and after the switch, it's H_final = -gamma * B * S_y. So the particle's time evolution after t=0 will be governed by H_final.

So the initial state is |+z⟩, and then at t=0, the Hamiltonian changes to H = -gamma * B * S_y. The question is about the time evolution of the average z-component of the magnetic moment, which is ⟨S_z⟩(t). The problem states that this average starts oscillating, and we need to find the oscillation frequency.

Okay, so to find ⟨S_z⟩(t), I need to compute the time evolution of the state under H_final and then take the expectation value of S_z. Let's recall that the time evolution of a quantum state is given by the time evolution operator U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ). But here, the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma * B * S_y. So H = ω * S_y, where ω = -gamma * B. Wait, but the units might need some attention. Let me check: the Hamiltonian should have units of energy. The magnetic moment mu has units of J/T (joules per tesla), so gamma has units of (J/T)/(J·s) )? Wait, no. Spin is dimensionless, so S has units of ħ. So the magnetic moment mu = gamma * S_z, so gamma must have units of (J/T)/(ħ), since S_z is in units of ħ. Therefore, gamma * B would have units of (J/T)/(ħ) * T = J/ħ, which is 1/s, since ħ has units of J·s. So gamma*B has units of frequency. Therefore, H = -gamma * B * S_y has units of ħ * frequency, which is energy. So that's correct.

Therefore, the frequency associated with the Hamiltonian is omega = gamma * B. But since H = -gamma * B * S_y, the energy levels are proportional to the eigenvalues of S_y. For spin-1/2, the eigenvalues of S_y are ± ħ/2. So the energy levels are E = -gamma * B * (ħ/2) and E = +gamma * B * (ħ/2). Wait, but the sign might depend on the direction. Wait, S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, so H = -gamma * B * S_y would have eigenvalues ∓ gamma * B * ħ/2. So the energy difference between the two states is delta E = gamma * B * ħ. Therefore, the transition frequency between these two states would be delta E / ħ = gamma * B. So the oscillation frequency in the expectation values would be related to this energy difference. But let me think through this more carefully.

The initial state is |+z⟩. Let's express this state in terms of the eigenstates of S_y, since the Hamiltonian after t=0 is proportional to S_y. The eigenstates of S_y are |+y⟩ and |-y⟩, with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2, respectively. So if I can write |+z⟩ as a linear combination of |+y⟩ and |-y⟩, then the time evolution under H will just add phase factors to each component, and the expectation value ⟨S_z⟩(t) can be calculated from the resulting state.

So first, let's find the expansion of |+z⟩ in the S_y eigenbasis. The eigenstates of S_y can be written in the Sz basis as:

|+y⟩ = (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩)/√2

|-y⟩ = (|+z⟩ - i |-z⟩)/√2

Therefore, to express |+z⟩ in terms of |+y⟩ and |-y⟩, we can invert these equations. Let's see:

Adding the two equations:

|+y⟩ + |-y⟩ = [ (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩) + (|+z⟩ - i |-z⟩) ] / √2 = (2 |+z⟩ ) / √2 = √2 |+z⟩

Therefore, |+z⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |-y⟩)/√2

Similarly, subtracting the two equations:

|+y⟩ - |-y⟩ = [ (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩) - (|+z⟩ - i |-z⟩) ] / √2 = (2i |-z⟩)/√2 = i√2 |-z⟩

But we don't need that for this problem. So, the initial state is |+z⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |-y⟩)/√2.

Now, the time evolution under the Hamiltonian H = -gamma * B * S_y. Let's write H as H = ω_0 S_y, where ω_0 = -gamma * B. Wait, but the sign might matter. Alternatively, maybe I should just keep it as H = -gamma B S_y. Let's proceed.

The time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ ). Since H is proportional to S_y, and the eigenstates of S_y are |+y⟩ and |-y⟩, the time evolution will act on these states by phase factors. Specifically, for each eigenstate |E⟩ of H with energy E, the time evolution is exp(-i E t / ħ ). So, for |+y⟩, the energy E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2), and for |-y⟩, E_- = +gamma B (ħ/2). Therefore, the time evolution of the initial state is:

|psi(t)⟩ = U(t) |+z⟩ = U(t) (|+y⟩ + |-y⟩)/√2 = [ exp(-i E_+ t / ħ ) |+y⟩ + exp(-i E_- t / ħ ) |-y⟩ ] / √2

Substituting E_+ and E_-:

E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2)

E_- = +gamma B (ħ/2)

Therefore,

|psi(t)⟩ = [ exp( i gamma B (ħ/2) t / ħ ) |+y⟩ + exp( -i gamma B (ħ/2) t / ħ ) |-y⟩ ] / √2

Simplify the exponents:

gamma B (ħ/2) t / ħ = (gamma B t)/2

So,

|psi(t)⟩ = [ exp( i (gamma B t)/2 ) |+y⟩ + exp( -i (gamma B t)/2 ) |-y⟩ ] / √2

Now, to compute ⟨S_z⟩(t), we need to find ⟨psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)⟩.

But S_z in the S_y basis might be a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to express |psi(t)⟩ back in the S_z basis and compute S_z there.

Wait, let's see. Let's first write |psi(t)⟩ in terms of |+z⟩ and |-z⟩. Since |+y⟩ and |-y⟩ are expressed in terms of |+z⟩ and |-z⟩, we can substitute those expressions into |psi(t)⟩.

Recall that:

|+y⟩ = (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩)/√2

|-y⟩ = (|+z⟩ - i |-z⟩)/√2

Therefore, substituting into |psi(t)⟩:

|psi(t)⟩ = [ exp( i (gamma B t)/2 ) (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩)/√2 + exp( -i (gamma B t)/2 ) (|+z⟩ - i |-z⟩)/√2 ] / √2

Factor out 1/√2 from each term:

|psi(t)⟩ = [ exp( i (gamma B t)/2 ) (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩) + exp( -i (gamma B t)/2 ) (|+z⟩ - i |-z⟩) ] / (√2 * √2 )

Which simplifies to:

|psi(t)⟩ = [ exp( i ω t / 2 ) (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩) + exp( -i ω t / 2 ) (|+z⟩ - i |-z⟩) ] / 2

Where I defined ω = gamma B for simplicity.

Let me compute each term:

First term: exp( i ω t / 2 ) |+z⟩ + exp( i ω t / 2 ) i |-z⟩

Second term: exp( -i ω t / 2 ) |+z⟩ - exp( -i ω t / 2 ) i |-z⟩

Adding them together:

[ exp( i ω t / 2 ) + exp( -i ω t / 2 ) ] |+z⟩ + i [ exp( i ω t / 2 ) - exp( -i ω t / 2 ) ] |-z⟩

Divide by 2:

[ (exp( i ω t / 2 ) + exp( -i ω t / 2 )) / 2 ] |+z⟩ + i [ (exp( i ω t / 2 ) - exp( -i ω t / 2 )) / 2 ] |-z⟩

Recognize that (exp(i x) + exp(-i x))/2 = cos x and (exp(i x) - exp(-i x))/2i = sin x. So:

= cos(ω t / 2) |+z⟩ + i * [ i sin(ω t / 2) ] |-z⟩

Because the second term is i times (exp(i x) - exp(-i x))/2, which is i * (2i sin x)/2 = i * i sin x = - sin x. Wait, let's check:

Wait, (exp(i x) - exp(-i x)) / 2i = sin x. Therefore, (exp(i x) - exp(-i x)) / 2 = i sin x. So in the second term, we have i * [ (exp(i x) - exp(-i x)) / 2 ] = i * (i sin x) = - sin x. Therefore:

|psi(t)⟩ = cos(ω t / 2) |+z⟩ - sin(ω t / 2) |-z⟩

So the time-evolved state is a superposition of |+z⟩ and |-z⟩ with coefficients cos(ω t / 2) and -sin(ω t / 2), respectively.

Now, to compute ⟨S_z⟩(t), we can use the fact that for a spin-1/2 particle, S_z has eigenvalues +ħ/2 for |+z⟩ and -ħ/2 for |-z⟩. Therefore, the expectation value is:

⟨S_z⟩(t) = |c_+|^2 (ħ/2) + |c_-|^2 (-ħ/2)

Where c_+ = cos(ω t / 2) and c_- = -sin(ω t / 2). Since |c_+|^2 = cos²(ω t / 2) and |c_-|^2 = sin²(ω t / 2), we have:

⟨S_z⟩(t) = [cos²(ω t / 2) - sin²(ω t / 2)] (ħ/2)

Using the double-angle identity cos²θ - sin²θ = cos(2θ), so:

⟨S_z⟩(t) = cos(ω t) * (ħ/2)

But wait, cos²(θ) - sin²(θ) = cos(2θ), so substituting θ = ω t / 2:

cos²(ω t / 2) - sin²(ω t / 2) = cos(ω t)

Therefore, ⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) cos(omega t)

But the problem asks for the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s moment. The average ⟨S_z⟩(t) oscillates as cos(omega t), so the frequency is omega / (2π). But in terms of angular frequency, it's omega. However, let's check the units and the expression.

Wait, omega was defined as gamma B. So the angular frequency is omega = gamma B, and the oscillation frequency (in Hz) is f = omega / (2π) = gamma B / (2π). But the problem might be asking for the angular frequency, which is often denoted as omega. However, the problem says "oscillation frequency," which usually refers to the ordinary frequency f. But in physics, sometimes angular frequency is also referred to as frequency, depending on context. Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem says, "What is its oscillation frequency?" Without specifying, but in quantum mechanics, when dealing with expectation values oscillating as cos(omega t), the frequency is omega/(2π). However, sometimes people just say "frequency" and mean angular frequency. Let me see.

But let's recall that the time evolution here is under the Hamiltonian H = -gamma B S_y. The energy difference between the eigenstates |+y⟩ and |-y⟩ is delta E = gamma B ħ. The frequency associated with this energy difference is delta E / h = gamma B ħ / h = gamma B / (2π), since h = 2π ħ. So that's the ordinary frequency. However, in the expression for ⟨S_z⟩(t), we have cos(omega t), where omega = gamma B. The ordinary frequency is omega / (2π) = gamma B / (2π). But let's check the calculation again.

Wait, in the expression ⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) cos(omega t), where omega = gamma B. So the argument of the cosine is omega t, which is angular frequency times time. Therefore, the angular frequency is omega = gamma B, and the ordinary frequency is gamma B / (2π). However, the problem might be expecting the answer in terms of angular frequency, as physicists often use angular frequency in such contexts. Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem mentions "oscillation frequency," and in the context of magnetic moments and spin precession, the Larmor frequency is usually given as omega = gamma B, which is the angular frequency. For example, the Larmor precession frequency is omega = gamma B. So in this case, since the magnetic field is along Y, and the initial spin is along Z, the spin will precess around the Y axis with the Larmor frequency omega = gamma B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency of the z-component would be the same as the Larmor frequency, which is gamma B. But let's confirm this with our calculation.

From our calculation, ⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t). Therefore, the angular frequency is gamma B, so the oscillation frequency is gamma B. Therefore, the answer is gamma B. But let me check if there's a factor of 2 missing. Wait, in the expression for ⟨S_z⟩(t), the argument of the cosine is gamma B t, so the angular frequency is gamma B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency in Hz would be gamma B / (2π), but the problem might be asking for the angular frequency. However, the problem doesn't specify units, so it's probably expecting the angular frequency, which is gamma B.

But wait, let's think again. The time evolution under H = -gamma B S_y. The energy levels are E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2) and E_- = gamma B (ħ/2). The difference is delta E = gamma B ħ. The frequency associated with this energy difference is delta E / ħ = gamma B. So transitions between these states would involve photons of frequency gamma B. But in the time evolution of the state, the phases evolve as exp(-i E_+ t / ħ ) and exp(-i E_- t / ħ ), leading to a phase difference of (E_- - E_+) t / ħ = (gamma B ħ) t / ħ = gamma B t. Therefore, the beat frequency between the two states is gamma B, which is the angular frequency of the oscillations in the expectation value. Therefore, the oscillation frequency of ⟨S_z⟩(t) is gamma B.

But let me check with another approach. Suppose we use the Heisenberg picture. The time evolution of S_z is governed by the Heisenberg equation:

dS_z/dt = (i/ħ)[H, S_z]

Since H = -gamma B S_y,

[H, S_z] = -gamma B [S_y, S_z] = -gamma B (i ħ S_x) (using the commutation relations [S_i, S_j] = i ħ ε_{ijk} S_k)

Therefore,

dS_z/dt = (i/ħ)(-gamma B)(i ħ S_x) = (i * -gamma B * i ħ S_x ) / ħ = (gamma B S_x )

So dS_z/dt = gamma B S_x

Similarly, we can write the Heisenberg equations for S_x and S_y. But perhaps we can form a system of equations. However, since the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, the Heisenberg equations will involve the commutators with S_y.

Alternatively, since we already have dS_z/dt = gamma B S_x, and we can find dS_x/dt:

dS_x/dt = (i/ħ)[H, S_x] = (i/ħ)(-gamma B [S_y, S_x]) = (i/ħ)(-gamma B (-i ħ S_z)) = (i/ħ)(gamma B i ħ S_z) = (i * gamma B * i) S_z = -gamma B S_z

Similarly, dS_y/dt = (i/ħ)[H, S_y] = (i/ħ)(-gamma B [S_y, S_y]) = 0

So the equations are:

dS_z/dt = gamma B S_x

dS_x/dt = -gamma B S_z

dS_y/dt = 0

These are similar to the equations of motion for a vector precessing around the y-axis. Since dS_y/dt = 0, S_y is constant. The other components satisfy:

d²S_z/dt² = gamma B dS_x/dt = gamma B (-gamma B S_z) = - (gamma B)^2 S_z

This is the equation for simple harmonic motion with angular frequency omega = gamma B. Therefore, S_z oscillates with angular frequency gamma B, which matches our previous conclusion.

Therefore, the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the magnetic moment is gamma B.

But wait, the problem says "the average of the z-component of the particle’s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?" So the answer is the angular frequency gamma B, which is often just referred to as the frequency in physics contexts. Therefore, the answer is gamma B.

But let me just confirm once more. From the expectation value calculation, we had ⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t). The cosine function has a period of 2π/(gamma B), so the frequency is gamma B/(2π) in cycles per second. However, in physics, when we talk about oscillation frequency in the context of quantum mechanics and expect an answer in terms of angular frequency (radians per second), we just say gamma B. But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe we need to check standard terminology here.

Wait, the Larmor frequency is omega_L = gamma B, which is the angular frequency. The ordinary frequency is omega_L / (2π). But in the context of this problem, when they say "oscillation frequency," it's possible they mean the angular frequency. For example, if you look at ⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) cos(omega t), then the angular frequency is omega, and the ordinary frequency is omega/(2π). But the problem might be expecting the answer as omega = gamma B. Let me check standard problems. In many textbooks, when you have a spin in a magnetic field and it precesses, the frequency is given as the Larmor frequency, which is gamma B, the angular frequency. Therefore, I think the answer is gamma B.

But to be absolutely sure, let's consider units. The oscillation frequency in Hz would have units of 1/s. Angular frequency also has units of 1/s. However, gamma has units of (rad s^{-1} T^{-1}) if we consider gamma = mu / (ħ/2), but actually, the gyromagnetic ratio gamma is defined such that the Larmor frequency omega = gamma B, so gamma has units of (rad s^{-1} T^{-1}), making omega have units of rad/s. Therefore, the answer is omega = gamma B, which is the angular frequency. Therefore, the oscillation frequency is gamma B radians per second. Since the problem doesn't specify whether it wants angular frequency or ordinary frequency, but in physics, especially in quantum mechanics, when we talk about frequencies in the context of oscillations like this, we usually refer to the angular frequency. Therefore, the answer is gamma B.

**Final Answer**
The oscillation frequency is \boxed{\gamma B}.

Okay, so I have this problem about a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is initially aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one in the +Y direction is turned on, both with the same magnitude B. The question is asking for the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. Hmm, let me try to work through this step by step.

First, I remember that the magnetic moment mu is related to the spin operator. For a spin-1/2 particle, the magnetic moment operator is given by mu = gamma * S, where gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, and S is the spin operator. In this case, since the initial magnetic field is along the +Z direction, the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with Sz. So initially, the system is in an eigenstate of Sz, right? Let me confirm: if the magnetic field is in +Z, the particle's spin will align with the field, so the initial state is either spin-up or spin-down along Z. But since it's aligned, I think it's spin-up. Wait, the problem says "aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction," so that would be the spin-up state, |+z⟩.

Then, the magnetic field is suddenly turned off, and another one is turned on along +Y. So the Hamiltonian changes abruptly from being proportional to Sz to being proportional to Sy. The magnitude of the magnetic field is the same, so the Hamiltonian before was H_initial = -mu · B = -gamma * B * Sz (since the field is along Z), and after the switch, it's H_final = -gamma * B * Sy. Wait, but the problem says both fields have the same magnitude B. So the initial Hamiltonian is H_initial = -gamma * B * S_z, and after switching, it's H_final = -gamma * B * S_y. But when the field is turned off, does that mean H becomes zero? Wait, the problem says "the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction; both fields have the same magnitude, B." Wait, maybe I misread. It says "both fields have the same magnitude, B." So the original field in Z has magnitude B, and the new field in Y also has magnitude B. So the initial Hamiltonian is H_initial = -gamma * B * S_z, and after the switch, it's H_final = -gamma * B * S_y. So the particle's time evolution after t=0 will be governed by H_final.

So the initial state is |+z⟩, and then at t=0, the Hamiltonian changes to H = -gamma * B * S_y. The question is about the time evolution of the average z-component of the magnetic moment, which is ⟨S_z⟩(t). The problem states that this average starts oscillating, and we need to find the oscillation frequency.

Okay, so to find ⟨S_z⟩(t), I need to compute the time evolution of the state under H_final and then take the expectation value of S_z. Let's recall that the time evolution of a quantum state is given by the time evolution operator U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ). But here, the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma * B * S_y. So H = ω * S_y, where ω = -gamma * B. Wait, but the units might need some attention. Let me check: the Hamiltonian should have units of energy. The magnetic moment mu has units of J/T (joules per tesla), so gamma has units of (J/T)/(J·s) )? Wait, no. Spin is dimensionless, so S has units of ħ. So the magnetic moment mu = gamma * S_z, so gamma must have units of (J/T)/(ħ), since S_z is in units of ħ. Therefore, gamma * B would have units of (J/T)/(ħ) * T = J/ħ, which is 1/s, since ħ has units of J·s. So gamma*B has units of frequency. Therefore, H = -gamma * B * S_y has units of ħ * frequency, which is energy. So that's correct.

Therefore, the frequency associated with the Hamiltonian is omega = gamma * B. But since H = -gamma * B * S_y, the energy levels are proportional to the eigenvalues of S_y. For spin-1/2, the eigenvalues of S_y are ± ħ/2. So the energy levels are E = -gamma * B * (ħ/2) and E = +gamma * B * (ħ/2). Wait, but the sign might depend on the direction. Wait, S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, so H = -gamma * B * S_y would have eigenvalues ∓ gamma * B * ħ/2. So the energy difference between the two states is delta E = gamma * B * ħ. Therefore, the transition frequency between these two states would be delta E / ħ = gamma * B. So the oscillation frequency in the expectation values would

I'm working with a problem about a spin-1/2 particle that has a magnetic moment mu, initially aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Suddenly, the magnetic field is switched off and replaced by another magnetic field in the +Y direction with the same magnitude B. I need to determine the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's magnetic moment.

I'll approach this systematically. The magnetic moment operator is related to the spin operator by mu = gamma * S, where gamma represents the gyromagnetic ratio. Initially, with the magnetic field along +Z, the particle's magnetic moment aligns with Sz. Since the problem indicates alignment with the +Z direction, the initial state must be the spin-up state |+z⟩.

When the field changes, the Hamiltonian transforms from H_initial = -gamma * B * S_z to H_final = -gamma * B * S_y. The magnetic field magnitude B remains constant during this transition. After t=0, the system's evolution is governed by H_final.

To find the oscillation frequency of ⟨S_z⟩(t), I need to calculate how the state evolves under H_final and then determine the expectation value of S_z. The time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ), with H = -gamma * B * S_y.

Let me verify the units: gamma must have units of (J/T)/(ħ) since S_z is measured in units of ħ. Therefore, gamma * B has units of frequency (1/s), making H = -gamma * B * S_y correctly expressed in energy units.

The frequency associated with this Hamiltonian is omega = gamma * B. For a spin-1/2 particle, S_y has eigenvalues of ±ħ/2, so the Hamiltonian H = -gamma * B * S_y has eigenvalues ∓gamma * B * ħ/2. The energy difference between these states is delta E = gamma * B * ħ, making the transition frequency delta E/ħ = gamma * B. This would be the oscillation frequency of the expectation values.

Alright, I have a problem involving a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, originally aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Suddenly, this magnetic field is deactivated, and a new one in the +Y direction, with the same magnitude B, is activated. The problem asks for the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. Let me work through it step-by-step.

First, I recall that the magnetic moment mu is connected to the spin operator. For a spin-1/2 particle, the magnetic moment operator is expressed as mu = gamma * S, where gamma represents the gyromagnetic ratio and S is the spin operator. Given that the initial magnetic field aligns along the +Z direction, the particle's magnetic moment aligns with Sz. Thus, the system initially is in an Sz eigenstate. To confirm, an initial magnetic field along +Z aligns the particle’s spin with the field, meaning the initial state is either spin-up or spin-down in Z. However, since it’s aligned, it's likely spin-up. When the problem states "aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction," it suggests the spin-up state, |+z⟩.

Next, the magnetic field is abruptly switched off, and another is switched on along +Y. Consequently, the Hamiltonian quickly shifts from being proportional to Sz to being proportional to Sy. Despite the switch, the magnetic field's magnitude remains constant; thus, the Hamiltonian initially was H_initial = -mu · B = -gamma * B * Sz, and post-change, it becomes H_final = -gamma * B * Sy. To clarify, both fields possess the same magnitude B. Therefore, initially, the Hamiltonian is H_initial = -gamma * B * S_z, and after transitioning, H_final = -gamma * B * S_y. Post t=0, the particle's time evolution is dictated by H_final.

Starting with the initial state |+z⟩, at t=0, the Hamiltonian modifies to H = -gamma * B * S_y. The question focuses on the time evolution of the average z-component of the magnetic moment, ⟨S_z⟩(t), which oscillates—and we need to identify the oscillation frequency.

In order to determine ⟨S_z⟩(t), I must compute the state's time evolution under H_final and then evaluate the expectation value of S_z. Time evolution in quantum mechanics is provided by the operator U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ), but here, the Hamiltonian H = -gamma * B * S_y. Thus, H = ω * S_y, where ω = -gamma * B. Checking units: the Hamiltonian should represent energy. The magnetic moment mu has units of J/T (joules per tesla), implying gamma has units of (J/T)/(J·s). Since spin is dimensionless, S has units of ħ. Therefore, mu = gamma * S_z infers gamma must have units of (J/T)/(ħ), as S_z is in ħ units. Consequently, gamma * B possesses units of (J/T)/(ħ) * T = J/ħ, translating to 1/s because ħ holds J·s units. Hence, gamma*B aligns with units of frequency. Therefore, H = -gamma * B * S_y is compatible with ħ * frequency, matching energy units.

Thus, the frequency associated with the Hamiltonian is omega = gamma * B. Since H = -gamma * B * S_y, energy levels relate to the eigenvalues of S_y. With spin-1/2, S_y has eigenvalues of ± ħ/2. Therefore, the energy levels equate to E = -gamma * B * (ħ/2) and E = +gamma * B * (ħ/2). Note: the sign depends on the direction. S_y's eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, so H = -gamma * B * S_y ensures eigenvalues ∓ gamma * B * ħ/2. Consequently, the energy disparity between states is delta E = gamma * B * ħ, and the associated transition frequency is delta E / ħ = gamma * B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency in expectation values matches the result.

The initial state is |+z⟩. Let\'s express this state in terms of the eigenstates of S_y. The eigenstates of S_y for spin-1/2 particles are |+y⟩ and |-y⟩, which can be written in terms of the eigenstates of S_z. The eigenstates of S_y are (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩)/√2 and (|+z⟩ - i |-z⟩)/√2, right? Let me recall: the Pauli matrices, S_y is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix sigma_y, which has eigenstates |+y⟩ = (|0⟩ + i|1⟩)/√2 and |-y⟩ = (|0⟩ - i|1⟩)/√2, where |0⟩ is |+z⟩ and |1⟩ is |-z⟩. So in terms of |+z⟩ and |-z⟩, |+y⟩ = (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩)/√2 and |-y⟩ = (|+z⟩ - i |-z⟩)/√2.\n\nTherefore, the initial state |+z⟩ can be written as a linear combination of |+y⟩ and |-y⟩. Let\'s compute that. Let me write |+z⟩ = a |+y⟩ + b |-y⟩. Using the expressions above:\n\n|+y⟩ = (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩)/√2\n\n|+z⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |-y⟩)/√2 * something. Wait, let\'s invert the relations. Let me solve for |+z⟩ and |-z⟩ in terms of |+y⟩ and |-y⟩.\n\nFrom |+y⟩ = (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩)/√2\n\nand |-y⟩ = (|+z⟩ - i |-z⟩)/√2\n\nIf we add these two equations:\n\n|+y⟩ + |-y⟩ = [ (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩) + (|+z⟩ - i |-z⟩) ] / √2 = (2 |+z⟩)/√2 = √2 |+z⟩\n\nTherefore, |+z⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |-y⟩)/√2\n\nSimilarly, subtracting the two equations:\n\n|+y⟩ - |-y⟩ = [ (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩) - (|+z⟩ - i |-z⟩) ] / √2 = (2i |-z⟩)/√2 = i√2 |-z⟩\n\nTherefore, |-z⟩ = (|+y⟩ - |-y⟩)/(i√2) = (-i)(|+y⟩ - |-y⟩)/√2\n\nBut maybe we don\'t need that. The key point is that |+z⟩ is an equal superposition of |+y⟩ and |-y⟩. So |+z⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |-y⟩)/√2.\n\nTherefore, the initial state is a superposition of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian H = -gamma * B * S_y. The time evolution of the state will be:\n\n|psi(t)⟩ = exp(-i H t / ħ) |+z⟩ = exp(-i (-gamma B S_y) t / ħ) |+z⟩\n\nWait, H is -gamma B S_y, so the time evolution operator is exp(-i H t / ħ) = exp(i gamma B S_y t / ħ)\n\nBut S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, so when acting on |+y⟩ and |-y⟩, the exponential becomes:\n\nFor |+y⟩: exp(i gamma B (ħ/2) t / ħ ) = exp(i gamma B t / 2 )\n\nSimilarly, for |-y⟩: exp(i gamma B (-ħ/2) t / ħ ) = exp(-i gamma B t / 2 )\n\nTherefore, the time-evolved state is:\n\n|psi(t)⟩ = [ exp(i gamma B t / 2 ) |+y⟩ + exp(-i gamma B t / 2 ) |-y⟩ ] / √2\n\nBut since |+y⟩ and |-y⟩ are themselves expressed in terms of |+z⟩ and |-z⟩, maybe we can write this back in the z-basis to compute ⟨S_z⟩(t).\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the expectation value ⟨S_z⟩(t) directly using this time-evolved state.\n\nFirst, let\'s note that S_z in the y-basis might be a bit complicated, but perhaps it\'s easier to express everything in the z-basis.\n\nWait, let\'s write |psi(t)⟩ in terms of |+z⟩ and |-z⟩. Since |+y⟩ = (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩)/√2 and |-y⟩ = (|+z⟩ - i |-z⟩)/√2, substituting into |psi(t)⟩:\n\n|psi(t)⟩ = [ exp(i gamma B t / 2 ) (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩)/√2 + exp(-i gamma B t / 2 ) (|+z⟩ - i |-z⟩)/√2 ] / √2\n\nLet me factor out 1/√2 from each term:\n\n= [ exp(i gamma B t / 2 ) (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩) + exp(-i gamma B t / 2 ) (|+z⟩ - i |-z⟩) ] / (√2 * √2 )\n\n= [ exp(i gamma B t / 2 ) (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩) + exp(-i gamma B t / 2 ) (|+z⟩ - i |-z⟩) ] / 2\n\nLet me expand the terms:\n\nFirst term: exp(i gamma B t / 2 ) |+z⟩ + i exp(i gamma B t / 2 ) |-z⟩\n\nSecond term: exp(-i gamma B t / 2 ) |+z⟩ - i exp(-i gamma B t / 2 ) |-z⟩\n\nAdding them together:\n\n[ exp(i gamma B t / 2 ) + exp(-i gamma B t / 2 ) ] |+z⟩ + i [ exp(i gamma B t / 2 ) - exp(-i gamma B t / 2 ) ] |-z⟩\n\nDivide by 2:\n\n= [ (exp(i gamma B t / 2 ) + exp(-i gamma B t / 2 )) / 2 ] |+z⟩ + i [ (exp(i gamma B t / 2 ) - exp(-i gamma B t / 2 )) / 2 ] |-z⟩\n\nRecognize that (exp(i x) + exp(-i x))/2 = cos x and (exp(i x) - exp(-i x))/2i = sin x. Therefore:\n\n= cos(gamma B t / 2 ) |+z⟩ - sin(gamma B t / 2 ) |-z⟩\n\nWait, let\'s check:\n\nThe coefficient of |+z⟩ is [ (exp(i gamma B t / 2 ) + exp(-i gamma B t / 2 )) / 2 ] = cos(gamma B t / 2 )\n\nThe coefficient of |-z⟩ is i [ (exp(i gamma B t / 2 ) - exp(-i gamma B t / 2 )) / 2 ] = i * [ i sin(gamma B t / 2 ) ] = - sin(gamma B t / 2 )\n\nTherefore, |psi(t)⟩ = cos(gamma B t / 2 ) |+z⟩ - sin(gamma B t / 2 ) |-z⟩\n\nSo the time-evolved state is a superposition of |+z⟩ and |-z⟩ with coefficients cos(omega t / 2) and -sin(omega t / 2), where omega = gamma B.\n\nNow, to compute ⟨S_z⟩(t), we can use the expectation value formula:\n\n⟨S_z⟩(t) = ⟨psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)⟩\n\nSince S_z for spin-1/2 is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix sigma_z, which in the z-basis is diagonal with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2. Therefore, the expectation value is:\n\n⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) [ |c_+|^2 - |c_-|^2 ]\n\nwhere c_+ is the coefficient of |+z⟩ and c_- is the coefficient of |-z⟩.\n\nFrom the state |psi(t)⟩, c_+ = cos(gamma B t / 2 ), c_- = - sin(gamma B t / 2 )\n\nTherefore,\n\n⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) [ |cos(gamma B t / 2 )|^2 - | - sin(gamma B t / 2 ) |^2 ]\n\nBut |cos|^2 and |sin|^2 are just cos^2 and sin^2, regardless of the sign.\n\nSo,\n\n⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) [ cos^2(gamma B t / 2 ) - sin^2(gamma B t / 2 ) ]\n\nUsing the double-angle identity: cos^2 x - sin^2 x = cos(2x)\n\nTherefore,\n\n⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t )\n\nSo the expectation value of S_z oscillates as cos(gamma B t ), with frequency gamma B. But wait, the problem says "oscillation frequency", which is the number of oscillations per unit time. The argument of the cosine is gamma B t, so the angular frequency omega is gamma B. Therefore, the frequency f is omega / (2 pi) = gamma B / (2 pi). But in physics, sometimes angular frequency is referred to as frequency when the context is clear. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says "What is its oscillation frequency?" In quantum mechanics, when talking about oscillation frequencies in expectation values, it\'s common to refer to the angular frequency. For example, in the Rabi oscillations, the frequency is given by the Rabi frequency, which is an angular frequency. So here, the expectation value of S_z is oscillating as cos(gamma B t), so the angular frequency is gamma B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency is gamma B. But let me confirm.\n\nWait, let\'s see. The time dependence is cos(gamma B t), so the period T is 2 pi / (gamma B), so the frequency f = 1/T = gamma B / (2 pi). But in terms of angular frequency, omega = 2 pi f = gamma B. So depending on the convention, the answer could be either gamma B or gamma B / (2 pi). However, in quantum mechanics, when we talk about the frequency of oscillation in expectation values, we usually mean the angular frequency. For example, in the context of spin precession, the Larmor frequency is omega = gamma B, which is the angular frequency. So I think the answer here is omega = gamma B. The problem doesn\'t specify whether it\'s angular frequency or regular frequency, but given that the options are likely expecting a simple multiple of gamma B, and the time dependence is cos(gamma B t), the oscillation frequency is gamma B. So the answer is gamma B.\n\nBut let me check my steps again to make sure I didn\'t make a mistake. Let\'s recap:\n\n1. The initial state is |+z⟩.\n\n2. The Hamiltonian changes to H = -gamma B S_y.\n\n3. The time evolution is governed by this Hamiltonian, so the state becomes a superposition of |+y⟩ and |-y⟩ with time-dependent phases.\n\n4. Expressing the time-evolved state back in the z-basis gives coefficients cos(gamma B t / 2 ) and -sin(gamma B t / 2 ).\n\n5. The expectation value of S_z is (ħ/2)(cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta)) = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).\n\n6. Therefore, the oscillation of ⟨S_z⟩ is proportional to cos(gamma B t), so the frequency is gamma B.\n\nYes, that seems correct. The key step was expanding the time evolution in terms of the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian and then converting back to the z-basis to compute the expectation value. The double-angle identity simplified the expression to a cosine with twice the argument, leading to the frequency gamma B.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to use the Heisenberg equation of motion. The time evolution of the operator S_z can be found by dS_z/dt = (i/ħ)[H, S_z]. Let\'s try that.\n\nGiven H = -gamma B S_y, so:\n\ndS_z/dt = (i/ħ) [ -gamma B S_y, S_z ]\n\nCompute the commutator [S_y, S_z] = i ħ S_x (using the commutation relations [S_i, S_j] = i ħ epsilon_{ijk} S_k )\n\nTherefore,\n\n[ -gamma B S_y, S_z ] = -gamma B [S_y, S_z] = -gamma B (i ħ S_x )\n\nTherefore,\n\ndS_z/dt = (i/ħ)( -gamma B i ħ S_x ) = (i * -gamma B i ħ / ħ ) S_x = ( -i^2 gamma B ) S_x = gamma B S_x (since i^2 = -1)\n\nSo dS_z/dt = gamma B S_x\n\nSimilarly, we can compute dS_x/dt:\n\ndS_x/dt = (i/ħ)[H, S_x] = (i/ħ)[ -gamma B S_y, S_x ]\n\nThe commutator [S_y, S_x] = -i ħ S_z\n\nTherefore,\n\n[ -gamma B S_y, S_x ] = -gamma B [S_y, S_x] = -gamma B (-i ħ S_z ) = i gamma B ħ S_z\n\nThus,\n\ndS_x/dt = (i/ħ)(i gamma B ħ S_z ) = (i * i gamma B ħ / ħ ) S_z = (- gamma B ) S_z\n\nSo we have the system of equations:\n\ndS_z/dt = gamma B S_x\n\ndS_x/dt = - gamma B S_z\n\nThis is similar to the equations of motion for harmonic oscillators. Let\'s take the second derivative of S_z:\n\nd²S_z/dt² = gamma B dS_x/dt = gamma B (- gamma B S_z ) = - (gamma B)^2 S_z\n\nSo the differential equation is d²S_z/dt² + (gamma B)^2 S_z = 0\n\nThis is the equation for simple harmonic motion with angular frequency omega = gamma B. Therefore, the expectation value ⟨S_z⟩(t) will oscillate with frequency gamma B. This confirms the previous result.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency is gamma B. So the answer is gamma B. But let me check units again to be sure. Gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, which has units of (rad/s)/T (radians per second per tesla), and B is in tesla, so gamma B has units of rad/s, which is angular frequency. Therefore, the oscillation frequency in terms of angular frequency is gamma B. If they wanted the frequency in Hz (cycles per second), it would be gamma B / (2 pi), but since the problem mentions "oscillation frequency" without specifying, and given the context of quantum mechanics where angular frequency is commonly used, the answer is gamma B.\n\nI think that\'s solid. Both methods—the Schrödinger picture time evolution and the Heisenberg picture equations of motion—lead to the same conclusion. So I\'m confident the oscillation frequency is gamma multiplied by B.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe oscillation frequency is \\boxed{\\gamma B}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745444970, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4032, prompt_tokens=1183, total_tokens=5215, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment \(\mu = \gamma S_z\) initially aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. When the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude \(B\), we need to determine the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's magnetic moment.

1. **Initial State and Hamiltonian Change**:
   - The initial state is \(|+z\rangle\), an eigenstate of \(S_z\).
   - The Hamiltonian changes from \(H_{\text{initial}} = -\gamma B S_z\) to \(H_{\text{final}} = -\gamma B S_y\).

2. **Time Evolution**:
   - The time evolution of the state is governed by the new Hamiltonian \(H = -\gamma B S_y\).
   - The eigenstates of \(S_y\) are \(|+y\rangle = \frac{|+z\rangle + i|-z\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}\) and \(|-y\rangle = \frac{|+z\rangle - i|-z\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}\).

3. **State Decomposition**:
   - The initial state \(|+z\rangle\) is expressed in terms of \(|+y\rangle\) and \(|-y\rangle\):
     \[
     |+z\rangle = \frac{|+y\rangle + |-y\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}
     \]

4. **Time-Evolved State**:
   - The time-evolved state under \(H = -\gamma B S_y\) is:
     \[
     |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{e^{i\gamma B t/2} |+y\rangle + e^{-i\gamma B t/2} |-y\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}
     \]
   - Converting back to the z-basis:
     \[
     |\psi(t)\rangle = \cos\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right) |+z\rangle - \sin\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right) |-z\rangle
     \]

5. **Expectation Value of \(S_z\)**:
   - The expectation value \(\langle S_z \rangle(t)\) is calculated as:
     \[
     \langle S_z \rangle(t) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \cos^2\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right) - \sin^2\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right) \right) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t)
     \]
   - This shows that \(\langle S_z \rangle(t)\) oscillates with angular frequency \(\gamma B\).

6. **Heisenberg Equation of Motion**:
   - Using the Heisenberg equation, the equations of motion for \(S_z\) and \(S_x\) lead to a harmonic oscillator equation:
     \[
     \frac{d^2 S_z}{dt^2} + (\gamma B)^2 S_z = 0
     \]
   - This confirms the angular frequency is \(\gamma B\).

The oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s magnetic moment is \(\boxed{\gamma B}\).

be related to this energy difference.

But let's do this more carefully. The initial state is |+z⟩. Let's express this state in terms of the eigenstates of S_y. The eigenstates of S_y for spin-1/2 particles are |+y⟩ and |-y⟩, which can be written in terms of the eigenstates of S_z. The eigenstates of S_y are (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩)/√2 and (|+z⟩ - i |-z⟩)/√2, right? Let me recall: the Pauli matrices, S_y is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix sigma_y, which has eigenstates |+y⟩ = (|0⟩ + i|1⟩)/√2 and |-y⟩ = (|0⟩ - i|1⟩)/√2, where |0⟩ is |+z⟩ and |1⟩ is |-z⟩. So in terms of |+z⟩ and |-z⟩, |+y⟩ = (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩)/√2 and |-y⟩ = (|+z⟩ - i |-z⟩)/√2.

Therefore, the initial state |+z⟩ can be written as a linear combination of |+y⟩ and |-y⟩. Let's compute that. Let me write |+z⟩ = a |+y⟩ + b |-y⟩. Using the expressions above:

|+y⟩ = (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩)/√2

|+z⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |-y⟩)/√2 * something. Wait, let's invert the relations. Let me solve for |+z⟩ and |-z⟩ in terms of |+y⟩ and |-y⟩.

From |+y⟩ = (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩)/√2

and |-y⟩ = (|+z⟩ - i |-z⟩)/√2

If we add these two equations:

|+y⟩ + |-y⟩ = [ (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩) + (|+z⟩ - i |-z⟩) ] / √2 = (2 |+z⟩)/√2 = √2 |+z⟩

Therefore, |+z⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |-y⟩)/√2

Similarly, subtracting the two equations:

|+y⟩ - |-y⟩ = [ (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩) - (|+z⟩ - i |-z⟩) ] / √2 = (2i |-z⟩)/√2 = i√2 |-z⟩

Therefore, |-z⟩ = (|+y⟩ - |-y⟩)/(i√2) = (-i)(|+y⟩ - |-y⟩)/√2

But maybe we don't need that. The key point is that |+z⟩ is an equal superposition of |+y⟩ and |-y⟩. So |+z⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |-y⟩)/√2.

Therefore, the initial state is a superposition of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian H = -gamma * B * S_y. The time evolution of the state will be:

|psi(t)⟩ = exp(-i H t / ħ) |+z⟩ = exp(-i (-gamma B S_y) t / ħ) |+z⟩

Wait, H is -gamma B S_y, so the time evolution operator is exp(-i H t / ħ) = exp(i gamma B S_y t / ħ)

But S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, so when acting on |+y⟩ and |-y⟩, the exponential becomes:

For |+y⟩: exp(i gamma B (ħ/2) t / ħ ) = exp(i gamma B t / 2 )

Similarly, for |-y⟩: exp(i gamma B (-ħ/2) t / ħ ) = exp(-i gamma B t / 2 )

Therefore, the time-evolved state is:

|psi(t)⟩ = [ exp(i gamma B t / 2 ) |+y⟩ + exp(-i gamma B t / 2 ) |-y⟩ ] / √2

But since |+y⟩ and |-y⟩ are themselves expressed in terms of |+z⟩ and |-z⟩, maybe we can write this back in the z-basis to compute ⟨S_z⟩(t).

Alternatively, we can compute the expectation value ⟨S_z⟩(t) directly using this time-evolved state.

First, let's note that S_z in the y-basis might be a bit complicated, but perhaps it's easier to express everything in the z-basis.

Wait, let's write |psi(t)⟩ in terms of |+z⟩ and |-z⟩. Since |+y⟩ = (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩)/√2 and |-y⟩ = (|+z⟩ - i |-z⟩)/√2, substituting into |psi(t)⟩:

|psi(t)⟩ = [ exp(i gamma B t / 2 ) (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩)/√2 + exp(-i gamma B t / 2 ) (|+z⟩ - i |-z⟩)/√2 ] / √2

Let me factor out 1/√2 from each term:

= [ exp(i gamma B t / 2 ) (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩) + exp(-i gamma B t / 2 ) (|+z⟩ - i |-z⟩) ] / (√2 * √2 )

= [ exp(i gamma B t / 2 ) (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩) + exp(-i gamma B t / 2 ) (|+z⟩ - i |-z⟩) ] / 2

Let me expand the terms:

First term: exp(i gamma B t / 2 ) |+z⟩ + i exp(i gamma B t / 2 ) |-z⟩

Second term: exp(-i gamma B t / 2 ) |+z⟩ - i exp(-i gamma B t / 2 ) |-z⟩

Adding them together:

[ exp(i gamma B t / 2 ) + exp(-i gamma B t / 2 ) ] |+z⟩ + i [ exp(i gamma B t / 2 ) - exp(-i gamma B t / 2 ) ] |-z⟩

Divide by 2:

= [ (exp(i gamma B t / 2 ) + exp(-i gamma B t / 2 )) / 2 ] |+z⟩ + i [ (exp(i gamma B t / 2 ) - exp(-i gamma B t / 2 )) / 2 ] |-z⟩

Recognize that (exp(i x) + exp(-i x))/2 = cos x and (exp(i x) - exp(-i x))/2i = sin x. Therefore:

= cos(gamma B t / 2 ) |+z⟩ - sin(gamma B t / 2 ) |-z⟩

Wait, let's check:

The coefficient of |+z⟩ is [ (exp(i gamma B t / 2 ) + exp(-i gamma B t / 2 )) / 2 ] = cos(gamma B t / 2 )

The coefficient of |-z⟩ is i [ (exp(i gamma B t / 2 ) - exp(-i gamma B t / 2 )) / 2 ] = i * [ i sin(gamma B t / 2 ) ] = - sin(gamma B t / 2 )

Therefore, |psi(t)⟩ = cos(gamma B t / 2 ) |+z⟩ - sin(gamma B t / 2 ) |-z⟩

So the time-evolved state is a superposition of |+z⟩ and |-z⟩ with coefficients cos(omega t / 2) and -sin(omega t / 2), where omega = gamma B.

Now, to compute ⟨S_z⟩(t), we can use the expectation value formula:

⟨S_z⟩(t) = ⟨psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)⟩

Since S_z for spin-1/2 is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix sigma_z, which in the z-basis is diagonal with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2. Therefore, the expectation value is:

⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) [ |c_+|^2 - |c_-|^2 ]

where c_+ is the coefficient of |+z⟩ and c_- is the coefficient of |-z⟩.

From the state |psi(t)⟩, c_+ = cos(gamma B t / 2 ), c_- = - sin(gamma B t / 2 )

Therefore,

⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) [ |cos(gamma B t / 2 )|^2 - | - sin(gamma B t / 2 ) |^2 ]

But |cos|^2 and |sin|^2 are just cos^2 and sin^2, regardless of the sign.

So,

⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) [ cos^2(gamma B t / 2 ) - sin^2(gamma B t / 2 ) ]

Using the double-angle identity: cos^2 x - sin^2 x = cos(2x)

Therefore,

⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t )

So the expectation value of S_z oscillates as cos(gamma B t ), with frequency gamma B. But wait, the problem says "oscillation frequency", which is the number of oscillations per unit time. The argument of the cosine is gamma B t, so the angular frequency omega is gamma B. Therefore, the frequency f is omega / (2 pi) = gamma B / (2 pi). But in physics, sometimes angular frequency is referred to as frequency when the context is clear. Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem says "What is its oscillation frequency?" In quantum mechanics, when talking about oscillation frequencies in expectation values, it's common to refer to the angular frequency. For example, in the Rabi oscillations, the frequency is given by the Rabi frequency, which is an angular frequency. So here, the expectation value of S_z is oscillating as cos(gamma B t), so the angular frequency is gamma B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency is gamma B. But let me confirm.

Wait, let's see. The time dependence is cos(gamma B t), so the period T is 2 pi / (gamma B), so the frequency f = 1/T = gamma B / (2 pi). But in terms of angular frequency, omega = 2 pi f = gamma B. So depending on the convention, the answer could be either gamma B or gamma B / (2 pi). However, in quantum mechanics, when we talk about the frequency of oscillation in expectation values, we usually mean the angular frequency. For example, in the context of spin precession, the Larmor frequency is omega = gamma B, which is the angular frequency. So I think the answer here is omega = gamma B. The problem doesn't specify whether it's angular frequency or regular frequency, but given that the options are likely expecting a simple multiple of gamma B, and the time dependence is cos(gamma B t), the oscillation frequency is gamma B. So the answer is gamma B.

But let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's recap:

1. The initial state is |+z⟩.

2. The Hamiltonian changes to H = -gamma B S_y.

3. The time evolution is governed by this Hamiltonian, so the state becomes a superposition of |+y⟩ and |-y⟩ with time-dependent phases.

4. Expressing the time-evolved state back in the z-basis gives coefficients cos(gamma B t / 2 ) and -sin(gamma B t / 2 ).

5. The expectation value of S_z is (ħ/2)(cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta)) = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).

6. Therefore, the oscillation of ⟨S_z⟩ is proportional to cos(gamma B t), so the frequency is gamma B.

Yes, that seems correct. The key step was expanding the time evolution in terms of the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian and then converting back to the z-basis to compute the expectation value. The double-angle identity simplified the expression to a cosine with twice the argument, leading to the frequency gamma B.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the Heisenberg equation of motion. The time evolution of the operator S_z can be found by dS_z/dt = (i/ħ)[H, S_z]. Let's try that.

Given H = -gamma B S_y, so:

dS_z/dt = (i/ħ) [ -gamma B S_y, S_z ]

Compute the commutator [S_y, S_z] = i ħ S_x (using the commutation relations [S_i, S_j] = i ħ epsilon_{ijk} S_k )

Therefore,

[ -gamma B S_y, S_z ] = -gamma B [S_y, S_z] = -gamma B (i ħ S_x )

Therefore,

dS_z/dt = (i/ħ)( -gamma B i ħ S_x ) = (i * -gamma B i ħ / ħ ) S_x = ( -i^2 gamma B ) S_x = gamma B S_x (since i^2 = -1)

So dS_z/dt = gamma B S_x

Similarly, we can compute dS_x/dt:

dS_x/dt = (i/ħ)[H, S_x] = (i/ħ)[ -gamma B S_y, S_x ]

The commutator [S_y, S_x] = -i ħ S_z

Therefore,

[ -gamma B S_y, S_x ] = -gamma B [S_y, S_x] = -gamma B (-i ħ S_z ) = i gamma B ħ S_z

Thus,

dS_x/dt = (i/ħ)(i gamma B ħ S_z ) = (i * i gamma B ħ / ħ ) S_z = (- gamma B ) S_z

So we have the system of equations:

dS_z/dt = gamma B S_x

dS_x/dt = - gamma B S_z

This is similar to the equations of motion for harmonic oscillators. Let's take the second derivative of S_z:

d²S_z/dt² = gamma B dS_x/dt = gamma B (- gamma B S_z ) = - (gamma B)^2 S_z

So the differential equation is d²S_z/dt² + (gamma B)^2 S_z = 0

This is the equation for simple harmonic motion with angular frequency omega = gamma B. Therefore, the expectation value ⟨S_z⟩(t) will oscillate with frequency gamma B. This confirms the previous result.

Therefore, the oscillation frequency is gamma B. So the answer is gamma B. But let me check units again to be sure. Gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, which has units of (rad/s)/T (radians per second per tesla), and B is in tesla, so gamma B has units of rad/s, which is angular frequency. Therefore, the oscillation frequency in terms of angular frequency is gamma B. If they wanted the frequency in Hz (cycles per second), it would be gamma B / (2 pi), but since the problem mentions "oscillation frequency" without specifying, and given the context of quantum mechanics where angular frequency is commonly used, the answer is gamma B.

I think that's solid. Both methods—the Schrödinger picture time evolution and the Heisenberg picture equations of motion—lead to the same conclusion. So I'm confident the oscillation frequency is gamma multiplied by B.

**Final Answer**
The oscillation frequency is \boxed{\gamma B}.

Let\'s take the initial state |psi(0)⟩ = |+z⟩. The eigenstates of S_y are |+y⟩ and |-y⟩, with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2, respectively. Expressing |+z⟩ in terms of |+y⟩ and |-y⟩:\n\n|+z⟩ = (|+y⟩ + i |-y⟩)/sqrt(2). \n\nUnder time evolution with H = -gamma * B * S_y, each eigenstate evolves with a phase factor. So,\n\n|psi(t)⟩ = exp(-i H t / ħ) |+z⟩ = [exp(-i (-gamma B S_y) t / ħ) (|+y⟩ + i |-y⟩)] / sqrt(2).\n\nBut H = -gamma B S_y, so H t / ħ = (-gamma B S_y t)/ħ. Therefore, the time evolution operator is exp(i gamma B S_y t / ħ). \n\nSince S_y |+y⟩ = (ħ/2) |+y⟩ and S_y |-y⟩ = (-ħ/2) |-y⟩, applying the time evolution operator:\n\nexp(i gamma B S_y t / ħ) |+y⟩ = exp(i gamma B (ħ/2) t / ħ) |+y⟩ = exp(i gamma B t / 2) |+y⟩,\n\nand similarly,\n\nexp(i gamma B S_y t / ħ) |-y⟩ = exp(-i gamma B t / 2) |-y⟩.\n\nTherefore, the state at time t is:\n\n|psi(t)⟩ = [exp(i gamma B t / 2) |+y⟩ + i exp(-i gamma B t / 2) |-y⟩] / sqrt(2).\n\nTo compute ⟨S_z⟩(t), we need to express S_z in terms of S_y eigenstates. Alternatively, perhaps it\'s easier to express |+y⟩ and |-y⟩ in terms of |+z⟩ and |-z⟩, then compute the expectation value.\n\nThe eigenstates of S_y are:\n\n|+y⟩ = (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩)/sqrt(2),\n\n|-y⟩ = (|+z⟩ - i |-z⟩)/sqrt(2).\n\nBut wait, let me check. The standard representation for spin-1/2 states:\n\nIn the z-basis, the eigenstates of S_y are given by:\n\n|+y⟩ = (1/sqrt(2)) (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩),\n\n|-y⟩ = (1/sqrt(2)) (|+z⟩ - i |-z⟩).\n\nSo, substituting these into |psi(t)⟩:\n\n|psi(t)⟩ = [exp(i gamma B t / 2) (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩)/sqrt(2) + i exp(-i gamma B t / 2) (|+z⟩ - i |-z⟩)/sqrt(2)] / sqrt(2).\n\nLet me simplify this expression step by step.\n\nFirst, factor out 1/sqrt(2) from each term:\n\n|psi(t)⟩ = (1/sqrt(2)) [exp(i gamma B t / 2) (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩) + i exp(-i gamma B t / 2) (|+z⟩ - i |-z⟩)] / sqrt(2).\n\nSo, combining the two 1/sqrt(2) factors, we get 1/2.\n\nThus,\n\n|psi(t)⟩ = (1/2) [exp(i gamma B t / 2) (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩) + i exp(-i gamma B t / 2) (|+z⟩ - i |-z⟩)].\n\nLet me distribute the terms:\n\nFirst term: exp(i gamma B t / 2) |+z⟩ + i exp(i gamma B t / 2) |-z⟩,\n\nSecond term: i exp(-i gamma B t / 2) |+z⟩ - i^2 exp(-i gamma B t / 2) |-z⟩.\n\nSince i^2 = -1, the second term becomes:\n\ni exp(-i gamma B t / 2) |+z⟩ + exp(-i gamma B t / 2) |-z⟩.\n\nNow, combine like terms for |+z⟩ and |-z⟩:\n\nFor |+z⟩:\n\n[exp(i gamma B t / 2) + i exp(-i gamma B t / 2)] |+z⟩,\n\nFor |-z⟩:\n\n[i exp(i gamma B t / 2) + exp(-i gamma B t / 2)] |-z⟩.\n\nTherefore, the state is:\n\n|psi(t)⟩ = (1/2) [ (exp(i gamma B t / 2) + i exp(-i gamma B t / 2)) |+z⟩ + (i exp(i gamma B t / 2) + exp(-i gamma B t / 2)) |-z⟩ ].\n\nLet me factor out exp(i gamma B t / 2) and exp(-i gamma B t / 2) terms:\n\nFor |+z⟩:\n\nexp(i gamma B t / 2) [1 + i exp(-i gamma B t)] / 2,\n\nWait, perhaps it\'s better to write the coefficients in terms of sine and cosine.

So both coefficients have a real and imaginary part proportional to [cos(theta) ± sin(theta)] and [cos(theta) ∓ sin(theta)].\n\nBut perhaps there\'s a better way to express these coefficients. Let me compute the modulus squared to check normalization, but maybe that\'s not necessary. Alternatively, let\'s compute the expectation value ⟨S_z⟩(t).\n\nThe expectation value of S_z is given by ⟨psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)⟩. Since S_z in the z-basis is diagonal with eigenvalues ħ/2 and -ħ/2 for |+z⟩ and |-z⟩ respectively.\n\nSo, the coefficients for |+z⟩ and |-z⟩ in |psi(t)⟩ are:\n\nc_+ = [exp(i theta) + i exp(-i theta)] / 2,\n\nc_- = [i exp(i theta) + exp(-i theta)] / 2,\n\nwhere theta = gamma B t / 2.\n\nThen, the expectation value ⟨S_z⟩ is (ħ/2)(|c_+|^2 - |c_-|^2).\n\nBut let\'s compute |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.\n\nFirst, compute |c_+|^2:\n\n|c_+|^2 = [exp(i theta) + i exp(-i theta)][exp(-i theta) - i exp(i theta)] / 4.\n\nWait, perhaps it\'s easier to compute |c_+|^2 as (c_+)(c_+^*).\n\nBut maybe even better to compute the product:\n\nc_+ = [exp(i theta) + i exp(-i theta)] / 2,\n\nso c_+^* = [exp(-i theta) - i exp(i theta)] / 2.\n\nTherefore,\n\n|c_+|^2 = (1/4)[exp(i theta) + i exp(-i theta)][exp(-i theta) - i exp(i theta)].\n\nMultiplying out the terms:\n\nexp(i theta) exp(-i theta) = 1,\n\nexp(i theta)(-i exp(i theta)) = -i exp(2i theta),\n\ni exp(-i theta) exp(-i theta) = i exp(-2i theta),\n\ni exp(-i theta)(-i exp(i theta)) = -i^2 exp(0) = 1.\n\nSo, combining these terms:\n\n1 - i exp(2i theta) + i exp(-2i theta) + 1.\n\nTherefore,\n\n|c_+|^2 = (1/4)[2 - i exp(2i theta) + i exp(-2i theta)].\n\nSimilarly, the cross terms can be simplified:\n\n-i exp(2i theta) + i exp(-2i theta) = i [exp(-2i theta) - exp(2i theta)] = i [ -2i sin(2 theta) ] = 2 sin(2 theta).\n\nTherefore,\n\n|c_+|^2 = (1/4)[2 + 2 sin(2 theta)] = (1/4)(2 + 2 sin(2 theta)) = (1/2)(1 + sin(2 theta)).\n\nSimilarly, compute |c_-|^2:\n\nc_- = [i exp(i theta) + exp(-i theta)] / 2,\n\nso c_-^* = [-i exp(-i theta) + exp(i theta)] / 2.\n\nThen,\n\n|c_-|^2 = (1/4)[i exp(i theta) + exp(-i theta)][-i exp(-i theta) + exp(i theta)].\n\nMultiplying out:\n\ni exp(i theta)(-i exp(-i theta)) = -i^2 exp(0) = 1,\n\ni exp(i theta) exp(i theta) = i exp(2i theta),\n\nexp(-i theta)(-i exp(-i theta)) = -i exp(-2i theta),\n\nexp(-i theta) exp(i theta) = 1.\n\nSo, combining terms:\n\n1 + i exp(2i theta) - i exp(-2i theta) + 1.\n\nAgain, the cross terms:\n\ni exp(2i theta) - i exp(-2i theta) = i [exp(2i theta) - exp(-2i theta)] = i [2i sin(2 theta)] = -2 sin(2 theta).\n\nTherefore,\n\n|c_-|^2 = (1/4)[2 - 2 sin(2 theta)] = (1/2)(1 - sin(2 theta)).\n\nThus, ⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2)(|c_+|^2 - |c_-|^2) = (ħ/2)[(1/2)(1 + sin(2 theta)) - (1/2)(1 - sin(2 theta))] = (ħ/2)(sin(2 theta)).\n\nSubstituting theta = gamma B t / 2,\n\n⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) sin(2 * gamma B t / 2) = (ħ/2) sin(gamma B t).\n\nTherefore, the expectation value of S_z oscillates sinusoidally with angular frequency omega = gamma B. The frequency f is omega/(2 pi) = gamma B/(2 pi), but the problem asks for the oscillation frequency, which is the angular frequency divided by 2 pi, but in physics, sometimes "frequency" refers to angular frequency. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says, "the average of the z-component of the particle’s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?" Since the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z, the average ⟨mu_z⟩(t) = gamma ⟨S_z⟩(t) = gamma*(ħ/2) sin(gamma B t). The time dependence is sin(gamma B t), so the angular frequency is gamma B, and the oscillation frequency (in Hz) is gamma B/(2 pi). However, in many contexts, especially in quantum mechanics, the term "frequency" when discussing oscillations like this refers to the angular frequency. But let me check the units.\n\nThe angular frequency omega has units of radians per second, while frequency nu has units of cycles per second (Hz). The problem doesn\'t specify, but given that the answer is requested in a box, and in physics problems like this, especially in quantum mechanics, the angular frequency is often referred to as the frequency. For example, the Larmor frequency is omega_L = gamma B, which is an angular frequency. However, sometimes Larmor frequency is given as nu_L = gamma B/(2 pi). The problem might be expecting the answer in terms of angular frequency. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem mentions "oscillation frequency". If the average of S_z is oscillating as sin(gamma B t), then the angular frequency is gamma B, and the frequency (in Hz) is gamma B/(2 pi). But the problem might be expecting the answer as the angular frequency. However, let\'s see the standard approach.\n\nThe time evolution of the spin in a magnetic field is governed by the Hamiltonian H = - gamma B S_y. The energy levels are E_+ = - gamma B (ħ/2) and E_- = gamma B (ħ/2). The energy difference is delta E = E_- - E_+ = gamma B ħ. The oscillation frequency for transitions between these states is delta E / ħ = gamma B. This is the angular frequency omega. Therefore, the oscillation frequency of ⟨S_z⟩ is omega = gamma B. So the answer is gamma B.\n\nBut let me confirm with the expression we derived: ⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) sin(gamma B t). The argument of the sine is gamma B t, so the angular frequency is indeed gamma B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency (angular) is gamma B. If the problem expects the answer in terms of angular frequency, then the answer is gamma B. If it expects the frequency in Hz, then it\'s gamma B/(2 pi). But the problem states "oscillation frequency", and in quantum mechanics contexts, when dealing with expectation values oscillating as sin(omega t), omega is referred to as the angular frequency, and the frequency is omega/(2 pi). However, the problem might not make this distinction and just ask for the frequency in terms of gamma and B. Let me check standard Larmor precession.\n\nThe Larmor frequency is omega_L = gamma B, which is the angular frequency. The actual frequency is nu_L = gamma B/(2 pi). But in many cases, especially in magnetic resonance, people refer to the Larmor frequency as omega_L = gamma B. However, the problem says "oscillation frequency", which could be either. But given that the time dependence is sin(gamma B t), the angular frequency is gamma B, and the frequency is gamma B/(2 pi). But the problem might be expecting the answer as gamma B/(2 pi). Wait, but let\'s check the units. If gamma has units of (rad/s)/T (since gamma = mu/(ħ)), then gamma B would have units of rad/s, which is angular frequency. So the oscillation frequency in Hz would be gamma B/(2 pi). But the problem says "oscillation frequency", which is ambiguous. However, in the context of the problem, since the average value is oscillating as sin(gamma B t), the angular frequency is gamma B, so the answer is gamma B. But I need to check standard references.\n\nWait, let\'s think about the time evolution. The state precesses around the Y-axis with angular frequency omega = gamma B. The expectation value of S_z would then oscillate with this frequency. Yes, because when you have a spin precessing around the Y-axis, the z-component oscillates sinusoidally with the angular frequency equal to the precession frequency, which is omega = gamma B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency of ⟨S_z⟩ is gamma B. Hence, the answer is gamma B.\n\nBut let me verify once more. The time evolution under H = - gamma B S_y leads to precession about the Y-axis. The precession angular frequency is given by omega = gamma B. The z-component of the spin will then oscillate with this frequency. Therefore, the oscillation frequency of ⟨S_z⟩ is omega = gamma B. So the answer is gamma B.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the time it takes for the argument of the sine function to go through 2 pi, the period T is 2 pi / (gamma B), so the frequency is 1/T = gamma B / (2 pi). But in the expression ⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) sin(gamma B t), the argument gamma B t must increase by 2 pi to complete one cycle. Therefore, the period T is 2 pi / (gamma B), so frequency nu = gamma B / (2 pi). But this is the cyclic frequency. However, in physics, especially in quantum mechanics and spin precession, the term "Larmor frequency" can refer to the angular frequency omega = gamma B. The problem might be using "oscillation frequency" to mean the angular frequency. But the problem statement says "average of the z-component of the particle’s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?" If they mean the number of oscillations per second (Hz), then it\'s gamma B/(2 pi). If they mean the angular frequency (rad/s), it\'s gamma B. The problem doesn\'t specify, but given that the answer is to be put in a box and likely expects a concise answer, and since the expression derived is sin(gamma B t), the angular frequency is gamma B, which is the standard answer in such contexts. However, to be thorough, let\'s check both possibilities.\n\nIn the expression ⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) sin(gamma B t), the angular frequency is gamma B, so the frequency in Hz is gamma B/(2 pi). But the problem might be expecting the answer in terms of angular frequency. However, the problem mentions "oscillation frequency", which in standard terms is the number of cycles per second, i.e., Hz. But in quantum mechanics literature, when discussing expectation values oscillating as sin(omega t), omega is often referred to as the frequency. For example, Rabi oscillations have a frequency Omega = ..., which is the angular frequency. So it\'s possible the answer is gamma B. However, to resolve this ambiguity, perhaps the problem expects the answer as gamma B divided by 2 pi. But given that the Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B S_y, the energy difference between the eigenstates is delta E = gamma B ħ, so the frequency associated with this energy difference is delta E / h = gamma B ħ / h = gamma B / (2 pi), since h = 2 pi ħ. This would be the frequency in Hz. Therefore, the oscillation frequency is gamma B / (2 pi). But earlier, when we derived ⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) sin(gamma B t), the argument of the sine is gamma B t, so the time period T is 2 pi / (gamma B), hence frequency nu = 1/T = gamma B / (2 pi). Therefore, the oscillation frequency in Hz is gamma B / (2 pi). But the problem might not want the factor of 2 pi, depending on the context. Wait, but the problem states that the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z. The Hamiltonian when the field is in Y is H = - mu · B = - gamma B S_y. The energy levels are E = ± (gamma B ħ)/2. The energy difference is delta E = gamma B ħ. The frequency corresponding to this energy difference is delta E / h = gamma B ħ / h = gamma B / (2 pi), which is the oscillation frequency of transitions between these states, which would correspond to the frequency of the expectation value oscillations. Therefore, the answer should be gamma B / (2 pi). But in our earlier derivation, ⟨S_z⟩(t) oscillates as sin(gamma B t), which has angular frequency gamma B, so the frequency is gamma B / (2 pi). Therefore, the answer is gamma B divided by 2 pi. However, the problem might be using angular frequency. Let me check standard references. For example, the Larmor frequency is omega_L = gamma B, which is the angular frequency. The Rabi frequency is also an angular frequency. In magnetic resonance, the frequency nu is omega/(2 pi). But the problem doesn\'t specify units. Given that the answer is to be given in a box, and the problem mentions "oscillation frequency", which could be either. However, in the expression for ⟨S_z⟩(t), the time dependence is sin(gamma B t), so the angular frequency is gamma B. Therefore, unless specified otherwise, the answer is likely gamma B. But to reconcile with the energy difference approach: the oscillation frequency of the expectation value is given by the energy difference divided by h-bar. The energy difference is delta E = gamma B ħ, so delta E / ħ = gamma B, which is the angular frequency. Therefore, the oscillation frequency of the expectation value is the angular frequency gamma B. Hence, the answer is gamma B. This makes sense because when you have two energy levels separated by delta E, the state precesses with angular frequency delta E / ħ. Therefore, the correct answer is gamma B. So I think the oscillation frequency referred to here is the angular frequency, so the answer is gamma B.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745445155, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4956, prompt_tokens=520, total_tokens=5476, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

The oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's magnetic moment is determined by the energy difference between the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian. After the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction, the Hamiltonian becomes \( H = -\gamma B S_y \). The eigenstates of \( S_y \) have energies \( \pm \frac{\gamma B \hbar}{2} \), leading to an energy difference \( \Delta E = \gamma B \hbar \). The oscillation frequency (angular frequency) is given by \( \omega = \Delta E / \hbar = \gamma B \).

**Answer:**  
The oscillation frequency is \(\boxed{\gamma B}\).

But let me confirm this by explicit calculation. Let's take the initial state |psi(0)⟩ = |+z⟩. The eigenstates of S_y are |+y⟩ and |-y⟩, with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2, respectively. Expressing |+z⟩ in terms of |+y⟩ and |-y⟩:

|+z⟩ = (|+y⟩ + i |-y⟩)/sqrt(2). 

Under time evolution with H = -gamma * B * S_y, each eigenstate evolves with a phase factor. So,

|psi(t)⟩ = exp(-i H t / ħ) |+z⟩ = [exp(-i (-gamma B S_y) t / ħ) (|+y⟩ + i |-y⟩)] / sqrt(2).

But H = -gamma B S_y, so H t / ħ = (-gamma B S_y t)/ħ. Therefore, the time evolution operator is exp(i gamma B S_y t / ħ). 

Since S_y |+y⟩ = (ħ/2) |+y⟩ and S_y |-y⟩ = (-ħ/2) |-y⟩, applying the time evolution operator:

exp(i gamma B S_y t / ħ) |+y⟩ = exp(i gamma B (ħ/2) t / ħ) |+y⟩ = exp(i gamma B t / 2) |+y⟩,

and similarly,

exp(i gamma B S_y t / ħ) |-y⟩ = exp(-i gamma B t / 2) |-y⟩.

Therefore, the state at time t is:

|psi(t)⟩ = [exp(i gamma B t / 2) |+y⟩ + i exp(-i gamma B t / 2) |-y⟩] / sqrt(2).

To compute ⟨S_z⟩(t), we need to express S_z in terms of S_y eigenstates. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express |+y⟩ and |-y⟩ in terms of |+z⟩ and |-z⟩, then compute the expectation value.

The eigenstates of S_y are:

|+y⟩ = (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩)/sqrt(2),

|-y⟩ = (|+z⟩ - i |-z⟩)/sqrt(2).

But wait, let me check. The standard representation for spin-1/2 states:

In the z-basis, the eigenstates of S_y are given by:

|+y⟩ = (1/sqrt(2)) (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩),

|-y⟩ = (1/sqrt(2)) (|+z⟩ - i |-z⟩).

So, substituting these into |psi(t)⟩:

|psi(t)⟩ = [exp(i gamma B t / 2) (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩)/sqrt(2) + i exp(-i gamma B t / 2) (|+z⟩ - i |-z⟩)/sqrt(2)] / sqrt(2).

Let me simplify this expression step by step.

First, factor out 1/sqrt(2) from each term:

|psi(t)⟩ = (1/sqrt(2)) [exp(i gamma B t / 2) (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩) + i exp(-i gamma B t / 2) (|+z⟩ - i |-z⟩)] / sqrt(2).

So, combining the two 1/sqrt(2) factors, we get 1/2.

Thus,

|psi(t)⟩ = (1/2) [exp(i gamma B t / 2) (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩) + i exp(-i gamma B t / 2) (|+z⟩ - i |-z⟩)].

Let me distribute the terms:

First term: exp(i gamma B t / 2) |+z⟩ + i exp(i gamma B t / 2) |-z⟩,

Second term: i exp(-i gamma B t / 2) |+z⟩ - i^2 exp(-i gamma B t / 2) |-z⟩.

Since i^2 = -1, the second term becomes:

i exp(-i gamma B t / 2) |+z⟩ + exp(-i gamma B t / 2) |-z⟩.

Now, combine like terms for |+z⟩ and |-z⟩:

For |+z⟩:

[exp(i gamma B t / 2) + i exp(-i gamma B t / 2)] |+z⟩,

For |-z⟩:

[i exp(i gamma B t / 2) + exp(-i gamma B t / 2)] |-z⟩.

Therefore, the state is:

|psi(t)⟩ = (1/2) [ (exp(i gamma B t / 2) + i exp(-i gamma B t / 2)) |+z⟩ + (i exp(i gamma B t / 2) + exp(-i gamma B t / 2)) |-z⟩ ].

Let me factor out exp(i gamma B t / 2) and exp(-i gamma B t / 2) terms:

For |+z⟩:

exp(i gamma B t / 2) [1 + i exp(-i gamma B t)] / 2,

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the coefficients in terms of sine and cosine. Let me use Euler's formula.

Let’s denote theta = gamma B t / 2.

Then, exp(i theta) = cos(theta) + i sin(theta),

exp(-i theta) = cos(theta) - i sin(theta).

So, the coefficient for |+z⟩ is:

exp(i theta) + i exp(-i theta) = [cos(theta) + i sin(theta)] + i [cos(theta) - i sin(theta)]

= cos(theta) + i sin(theta) + i cos(theta) + sin(theta)

= [cos(theta) + sin(theta)] + i [sin(theta) + cos(theta)]

Wait, that seems a bit messy. Let me compute it step by step:

First term: exp(i theta) = cos(theta) + i sin(theta),

Second term: i exp(-i theta) = i [cos(theta) - i sin(theta)] = i cos(theta) + sin(theta).

Adding them together:

cos(theta) + i sin(theta) + i cos(theta) + sin(theta) = [cos(theta) + sin(theta)] + i [sin(theta) + cos(theta)].

Similarly, the coefficient for |-z⟩ is:

i exp(i theta) + exp(-i theta) = i [cos(theta) + i sin(theta)] + [cos(theta) - i sin(theta)]

= i cos(theta) - sin(theta) + cos(theta) - i sin(theta)

= [cos(theta) - sin(theta)] + i [cos(theta) - sin(theta)].

Wait, let me check that again:

i exp(i theta) = i cos(theta) + i^2 sin(theta) = i cos(theta) - sin(theta),

exp(-i theta) = cos(theta) - i sin(theta).

Adding these:

i cos(theta) - sin(theta) + cos(theta) - i sin(theta) = [cos(theta) - sin(theta)] + i [cos(theta) - sin(theta)].

Hmm, interesting. So both coefficients have a real and imaginary part proportional to [cos(theta) ± sin(theta)] and [cos(theta) ∓ sin(theta)].

But perhaps there's a better way to express these coefficients. Let me compute the modulus squared to check normalization, but maybe that's not necessary. Alternatively, let's compute the expectation value ⟨S_z⟩(t).

The expectation value of S_z is given by ⟨psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)⟩. Since S_z in the z-basis is diagonal with eigenvalues ħ/2 and -ħ/2 for |+z⟩ and |-z⟩ respectively.

So, the coefficients for |+z⟩ and |-z⟩ in |psi(t)⟩ are:

c_+ = [exp(i theta) + i exp(-i theta)] / 2,

c_- = [i exp(i theta) + exp(-i theta)] / 2,

where theta = gamma B t / 2.

Then, the expectation value ⟨S_z⟩ is (ħ/2)(|c_+|^2 - |c_-|^2).

But let's compute |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

First, compute |c_+|^2:

|c_+|^2 = [exp(i theta) + i exp(-i theta)][exp(-i theta) - i exp(i theta)] / 4.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute |c_+|^2 as (c_+)(c_+^*).

But maybe even better to compute the product:

c_+ = [exp(i theta) + i exp(-i theta)] / 2,

so c_+^* = [exp(-i theta) - i exp(i theta)] / 2.

Therefore,

|c_+|^2 = (1/4)[exp(i theta) + i exp(-i theta)][exp(-i theta) - i exp(i theta)].

Multiplying out the terms:

exp(i theta) exp(-i theta) = 1,

exp(i theta)(-i exp(i theta)) = -i exp(2i theta),

i exp(-i theta) exp(-i theta) = i exp(-2i theta),

i exp(-i theta)(-i exp(i theta)) = -i^2 exp(0) = 1.

So, combining these terms:

1 - i exp(2i theta) + i exp(-2i theta) + 1.

Therefore,

|c_+|^2 = (1/4)[2 - i exp(2i theta) + i exp(-2i theta)].

Similarly, the cross terms can be simplified:

-i exp(2i theta) + i exp(-2i theta) = i [exp(-2i theta) - exp(2i theta)] = i [ -2i sin(2 theta) ] = 2 sin(2 theta).

Therefore,

|c_+|^2 = (1/4)[2 + 2 sin(2 theta)] = (1/4)(2 + 2 sin(2 theta)) = (1/2)(1 + sin(2 theta)).

Similarly, compute |c_-|^2:

c_- = [i exp(i theta) + exp(-i theta)] / 2,

so c_-^* = [-i exp(-i theta) + exp(i theta)] / 2.

Then,

|c_-|^2 = (1/4)[i exp(i theta) + exp(-i theta)][-i exp(-i theta) + exp(i theta)].

Multiplying out:

i exp(i theta)(-i exp(-i theta)) = -i^2 exp(0) = 1,

i exp(i theta) exp(i theta) = i exp(2i theta),

exp(-i theta)(-i exp(-i theta)) = -i exp(-2i theta),

exp(-i theta) exp(i theta) = 1.

So, combining terms:

1 + i exp(2i theta) - i exp(-2i theta) + 1.

Again, the cross terms:

i exp(2i theta) - i exp(-2i theta) = i [exp(2i theta) - exp(-2i theta)] = i [2i sin(2 theta)] = -2 sin(2 theta).

Therefore,

|c_-|^2 = (1/4)[2 - 2 sin(2 theta)] = (1/2)(1 - sin(2 theta)).

Thus, ⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2)(|c_+|^2 - |c_-|^2) = (ħ/2)[(1/2)(1 + sin(2 theta)) - (1/2)(1 - sin(2 theta))] = (ħ/2)(sin(2 theta)).

Substituting theta = gamma B t / 2,

⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) sin(2 * gamma B t / 2) = (ħ/2) sin(gamma B t).

Therefore, the expectation value of S_z oscillates sinusoidally with angular frequency omega = gamma B. The frequency f is omega/(2 pi) = gamma B/(2 pi), but the problem asks for the oscillation frequency, which is the angular frequency divided by 2 pi, but in physics, sometimes "frequency" refers to angular frequency. Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem says, "the average of the z-component of the particle’s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?" Since the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z, the average ⟨mu_z⟩(t) = gamma ⟨S_z⟩(t) = gamma*(ħ/2) sin(gamma B t). The time dependence is sin(gamma B t), so the angular frequency is gamma B, and the oscillation frequency (in Hz) is gamma B/(2 pi). However, in many contexts, especially in quantum mechanics, the term "frequency" when discussing oscillations like this refers to the angular frequency. But let me check the units.

The angular frequency omega has units of radians per second, while frequency nu has units of cycles per second (Hz). The problem doesn't specify, but given that the answer is requested in a box, and in physics problems like this, especially in quantum mechanics, the angular frequency is often referred to as the frequency. For example, the Larmor frequency is omega_L = gamma B, which is an angular frequency. However, sometimes Larmor frequency is given as nu_L = gamma B/(2 pi). The problem might be expecting the answer in terms of angular frequency. Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem mentions "oscillation frequency". If the average of S_z is oscillating as sin(gamma B t), then the angular frequency is gamma B, and the frequency (in Hz) is gamma B/(2 pi). But the problem might be expecting the answer as the angular frequency. However, let's see the standard approach.

The time evolution of the spin in a magnetic field is governed by the Hamiltonian H = - gamma B S_y. The energy levels are E_+ = - gamma B (ħ/2) and E_- = gamma B (ħ/2). The energy difference is delta E = E_- - E_+ = gamma B ħ. The oscillation frequency for transitions between these states is delta E / ħ = gamma B. This is the angular frequency omega. Therefore, the oscillation frequency of ⟨S_z⟩ is omega = gamma B. So the answer is gamma B.

But let me confirm with the expression we derived: ⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) sin(gamma B t). The argument of the sine is gamma B t, so the angular frequency is indeed gamma B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency (angular) is gamma B. If the problem expects the answer in terms of angular frequency, then the answer is gamma B. If it expects the frequency in Hz, then it's gamma B/(2 pi). But the problem states "oscillation frequency", and in quantum mechanics contexts, when dealing with expectation values oscillating as sin(omega t), omega is referred to as the angular frequency, and the frequency is omega/(2 pi). However, the problem might not make this distinction and just ask for the frequency in terms of gamma and B. Let me check standard Larmor precession.

The Larmor frequency is omega_L = gamma B, which is the angular frequency. The actual frequency is nu_L = gamma B/(2 pi). But in many cases, especially in magnetic resonance, people refer to the Larmor frequency as omega_L = gamma B. However, the problem says "oscillation frequency", which could be either. But given that the time dependence is sin(gamma B t), the angular frequency is gamma B, and the frequency is gamma B/(2 pi). But the problem might be expecting the answer as gamma B/(2 pi). Wait, but let's check the units. If gamma has units of (rad/s)/T (since gamma = mu/(ħ)), then gamma B would have units of rad/s, which is angular frequency. So the oscillation frequency in Hz would be gamma B/(2 pi). But the problem says "oscillation frequency", which is ambiguous. However, in the context of the problem, since the average value is oscillating as sin(gamma B t), the angular frequency is gamma B, so the answer is gamma B. But I need to check standard references.

Wait, let's think about the time evolution. The state precesses around the Y-axis with angular frequency omega = gamma B. The expectation value of S_z would then oscillate with this frequency. Yes, because when you have a spin precessing around the Y-axis, the z-component oscillates sinusoidally with the angular frequency equal to the precession frequency, which is omega = gamma B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency of ⟨S_z⟩ is gamma B. Hence, the answer is gamma B.

But let me verify once more. The time evolution under H = - gamma B S_y leads to precession about the Y-axis. The precession angular frequency is given by omega = gamma B. The z-component of the spin will then oscillate with this frequency. Therefore, the oscillation frequency of ⟨S_z⟩ is omega = gamma B. So the answer is gamma B.

Alternatively, if we consider the time it takes for the argument of the sine function to go through 2 pi, the period T is 2 pi / (gamma B), so the frequency is 1/T = gamma B / (2 pi). But in the expression ⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) sin(gamma B t), the argument gamma B t must increase by 2 pi to complete one cycle. Therefore, the period T is 2 pi / (gamma B), so frequency nu = gamma B / (2 pi). But this is the cyclic frequency. However, in physics, especially in quantum mechanics and spin precession, the term "Larmor frequency" can refer to the angular frequency omega = gamma B. The problem might be using "oscillation frequency" to mean the angular frequency. But the problem statement says "average of the z-component of the particle’s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?" If they mean the number of oscillations per second (Hz), then it's gamma B/(2 pi). If they mean the angular frequency (rad/s), it's gamma B. The problem doesn't specify, but given that the answer is to be put in a box and likely expects a concise answer, and since the expression derived is sin(gamma B t), the angular frequency is gamma B, which is the standard answer in such contexts. However, to be thorough, let's check both possibilities.

In the expression ⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) sin(gamma B t), the angular frequency is gamma B, so the frequency in Hz is gamma B/(2 pi). But the problem might be expecting the answer in terms of angular frequency. However, the problem mentions "oscillation frequency", which in standard terms is the number of cycles per second, i.e., Hz. But in quantum mechanics literature, when discussing expectation values oscillating as sin(omega t), omega is often referred to as the frequency. For example, Rabi oscillations have a frequency Omega = ..., which is the angular frequency. So it's possible the answer is gamma B. However, to resolve this ambiguity, perhaps the problem expects the answer as gamma B divided by 2 pi. But given that the Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B S_y, the energy difference between the eigenstates is delta E = gamma B ħ, so the frequency associated with this energy difference is delta E / h = gamma B ħ / h = gamma B / (2 pi), since h = 2 pi ħ. This would be the frequency in Hz. Therefore, the oscillation frequency is gamma B / (2 pi). But earlier, when we derived ⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) sin(gamma B t), the argument of the sine is gamma B t, so the time period T is 2 pi / (gamma B), hence frequency nu = 1/T = gamma B / (2 pi). Therefore, the oscillation frequency in Hz is gamma B / (2 pi). But the problem might not want the factor of 2 pi, depending on the context. Wait, but the problem states that the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z. The Hamiltonian when the field is in Y is H = - mu · B = - gamma B S_y. The energy levels are E = ± (gamma B ħ)/2. The energy difference is delta E = gamma B ħ. The frequency corresponding to this energy difference is delta E / h = gamma B ħ / h = gamma B / (2 pi), which is the oscillation frequency of transitions between these states, which would correspond to the frequency of the expectation value oscillations. Therefore, the answer should be gamma B / (2 pi). But in our earlier derivation, ⟨S_z⟩(t) oscillates as sin(gamma B t), which has angular frequency gamma B, so the frequency is gamma B / (2 pi). Therefore, the answer is gamma B divided by 2 pi. However, the problem might be using angular frequency. Let me check standard references. For example, the Larmor frequency is omega_L = gamma B, which is the angular frequency. The Rabi frequency is also an angular frequency. In magnetic resonance, the frequency nu is omega/(2 pi). But the problem doesn't specify units. Given that the answer is to be given in a box, and the problem mentions "oscillation frequency", which could be either. However, in the expression for ⟨S_z⟩(t), the time dependence is sin(gamma B t), so the angular frequency is gamma B. Therefore, unless specified otherwise, the answer is likely gamma B. But to reconcile with the energy difference approach: the oscillation frequency of the expectation value is given by the energy difference divided by h-bar. The energy difference is delta E = gamma B ħ, so delta E / ħ = gamma B, which is the angular frequency. Therefore, the oscillation frequency of the expectation value is the angular frequency gamma B. Hence, the answer is gamma B. This makes sense because when you have two energy levels separated by delta E, the state precesses with angular frequency delta E / ħ. Therefore, the correct answer is gamma B. So I think the oscillation frequency referred to here is the angular frequency, so the answer is gamma B.

Let\'s express this state in terms of the eigenstates of S_y. The eigenstates of S_y for spin-1/2 are |+y⟩ and |-y⟩, given by:\n\n|+y⟩ = (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩)/√2\n\n|-y⟩ = (|+z⟩ - i |-z⟩)/√2\n\nTherefore, to express |+z⟩ in terms of |+y⟩ and |-y⟩, we can invert these equations.

The time evolution under H_final = -gamma * B * S_y. Let\'s write the time evolution operator:\n\nU(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ ) = exp( i gamma B S_y t / ħ )\n\nBecause H = -gamma B S_y, so H t / ħ = -gamma B S_y t / ħ, hence the negative sign cancels when moving to the exponential.\n\nAlternatively, H = ω S_y, where ω = -gamma B. So, U(t) = exp(-i ω S_y t / ħ )\n\nBut perhaps it\'s clearer to proceed with the given H.\n\nSince |+y⟩ and |-y⟩ are eigenstates of S_y, their time evolution under H is straightforward. The state |+y⟩ has eigenvalue +ħ/2 for S_y, so under H = -gamma B S_y, the energy eigenvalue is E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2). Similarly, |-y⟩ has eigenvalue -ħ/2, so E_- = +gamma B (ħ/2).\n\nTherefore, the time evolution of |+y⟩ is:\n\n|+y⟩ → exp(-i E_+ t / ħ ) |+y⟩ = exp( i gamma B (ħ/2) t / ħ ) |+y⟩ = exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) |+y⟩\n\nSimilarly, |-y⟩ → exp(-i E_- t / ħ ) |-y⟩ = exp( -i gamma B (ħ/2) t / ħ ) |-y⟩ = exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) |-y⟩\n\nTherefore, the initial state |+z⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |-y⟩)/√2 evolves as:\n\n|psi(t)⟩ = [ exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) |+y⟩ + exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) |-y⟩ ] / √2\n\nTo compute ⟨ S_z ⟩(t), we need to find ⟨ psi(t) | S_z | psi(t) ⟩.\n\nFirst, let\'s express S_z in terms of |+y⟩ and |-y⟩.

The operator S_z in the z-basis has eigenvalues +ħ/2 for |+z⟩ and -ħ/2 for |-z⟩. Therefore, the expectation value is:\n\n⟨ S_z ⟩(t) = |⟨+z | psi(t)⟩|^2 (ħ/2) + |⟨-z | psi(t)⟩|^2 (-ħ/2 )\n\nBut since |psi(t)⟩ is expressed as a combination of |+z⟩ and |-z⟩, the coefficients squared give the probabilities. Alternatively, since the state is:\n\n|psi(t)⟩ = cos(theta) |+z⟩ - sin(theta) |-z⟩, where theta = gamma B t / 2\n\nThen, the expectation value is:\n\n⟨ S_z ⟩(t) = |cos(theta)|^2 (ħ/2) + |sin(theta)|^2 (-ħ/2 )\n\n= [ cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ] (ħ/2 )\n\n= cos(2 theta) (ħ/2 )\n\nSubstituting theta = gamma B t / 2:\n\n⟨ S_z ⟩(t) = cos(gamma B t) * (ħ/2 )\n\nTherefore, the expectation value of S_z oscillates as cos(gamma B t) multiplied by ħ/2. The oscillation frequency is the coefficient of t in the cosine argument, which is gamma B. Therefore, the frequency is gamma B divided by 2π to convert angular frequency to regular frequency. Wait, but in physics, when we talk about oscillation frequency in terms of angular frequency (omega), we often just refer to omega as the frequency. However, the problem states "oscillation frequency," which could be either the angular frequency (radians per second) or the regular frequency (cycles per second, Hz). The problem doesn\'t specify, but in quantum mechanics contexts, when dealing with expectation values oscillating as cos(omega t), the omega is the angular frequency. However, the problem might just be expecting the angular frequency. Let me check.\n\nThe problem says "oscillation frequency," which in standard terms is cycles per second (Hz), which is omega/(2π). But in physics, especially in quantum mechanics, sometimes people refer to angular frequency as just frequency. Let me check the problem again. The problem says "average of the z-component of the particle’s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?" The key is that the expectation value is proportional to cos(gamma B t), so the angular frequency is gamma B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency in radians per second is gamma B. If they want the frequency in Hz, it\'s gamma B / (2π). But the problem doesn\'t specify, so perhaps we need to check the units. The problem states that mu = gamma S_z. The magnetic moment mu has units of J/T. S_z is in units of ħ (since spin is in units of ħ). Therefore, gamma must have units of (J/T)/ (J·s) ) = 1/(T·s). Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, S_z is dimensionless in some unit systems, but actually, spin is measured in units of ħ. So S_z is in ħ units. Therefore, mu = gamma * S_z, so gamma has units of (J/T) / (ħ). Since ħ has units of J·s, gamma has units of (J/T)/(J·s) ) = 1/(T·s). Then, gamma * B (where B is in T) gives units of 1/s, which is angular frequency (rad/s). Therefore, the angular frequency is omega = gamma B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency in radians per second is gamma B, and in Hz, it\'s gamma B / (2π). But the problem says "oscillation frequency," which is ambiguous. However, in the context of quantum mechanics, when you have an expression like cos(omega t), omega is the angular frequency. However, the problem might be expecting the answer in terms of the Larmor frequency, which is omega = gamma B, which is angular frequency. But let\'s check the standard approach.\n\nThe Larmor frequency is given by omega = gamma B, which is the angular frequency. The oscillation frequency of the expectation value would be this angular frequency. However, in the expression we derived, ⟨ S_z ⟩(t) = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t), so the argument of the cosine is gamma B t, so the angular frequency is gamma B, and the regular frequency is gamma B / (2π). But the problem doesn\'t specify, so perhaps we need to answer with the angular frequency. However, in many contexts, when someone refers to "frequency" without specifying, they might mean the angular frequency. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is gamma B / (2π). But let\'s check the problem again.\n\nWait, the problem says "the average of the z-component of the particle’s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?" The average is ⟨ mu_z ⟩ = gamma ⟨ S_z ⟩. From our calculation, ⟨ S_z ⟩(t) = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t), so ⟨ mu_z ⟩(t) = gamma (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t). Therefore, the oscillation of ⟨ mu_z ⟩ is at angular frequency gamma B. Therefore, the frequency is gamma B / (2π) if they want cycles per second, but the problem might just want the angular frequency. However, in quantum mechanics, when we talk about transition frequencies or oscillation frequencies in expectation values, we usually refer to the angular frequency. For example, Rabi oscillations have a frequency given by the Rabi frequency, which is an angular frequency. Therefore, the answer is likely gamma B. However, let\'s check the standard formula for spin precession.\n\nWhen a magnetic moment is placed in a magnetic field, it precesses around the field with the Larmor frequency, which is omega = gamma B. The precession frequency is omega = gamma B. In this case, the magnetic field is along Y, so the spin precesses around Y, causing the z-component to oscillate. The frequency of this oscillation is the Larmor frequency, which is gamma B. Therefore, the answer is gamma B. However, in our calculation, we found ⟨ S_z ⟩(t) = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t), so the angular frequency is gamma B, which matches the Larmor frequency. Therefore, the oscillation frequency is gamma B. Hence, the answer is gamma B. But let me confirm once more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B S_y, so the energy levels are E = ± (gamma B ħ / 2). The energy difference is delta E = gamma B ħ. The oscillation frequency in transitions between these states would be delta E / ħ = gamma B. Therefore, the Rabi frequency is gamma B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency of the expectation value is gamma B. Therefore, the answer is gamma B.\n\nBut let me check with another approach. Suppose we use the Heisenberg picture. The time evolution of S_z is governed by the Heisenberg equation:\n\ndS_z/dt = (i/ħ)[H, S_z]\n\nGiven H = - gamma B S_y, so:\n\ndS_z/dt = (i/ħ)( - gamma B [S_y, S_z] )\n\nThe commutator [S_y, S_z] = i ħ S_x (using the commutation relations [S_i, S_j] = i ħ ε_{ijk} S_k )\n\nTherefore:\n\ndS_z/dt = (i/ħ)( - gamma B (i ħ S_x ) ) = (i/ħ)( - gamma B i ħ S_x ) = (i * i)( - gamma B S_x ) = (-1)( - gamma B S_x ) = gamma B S_x\n\nSimilarly, we can write the Heisenberg equations for S_x and S_y. However, since we are interested in S_z, let\'s proceed.\n\nSo, dS_z/dt = gamma B S_x\n\nSimilarly, we can compute dS_x/dt:\n\ndS_x/dt = (i/ħ)[H, S_x] = (i/ħ)( - gamma B [S_y, S_x] )\n\n[S_y, S_x] = - [S_x, S_y] = -i ħ S_z\n\nTherefore:\n\ndS_x/dt = (i/ħ)( - gamma B ( -i ħ S_z ) ) = (i/ħ)( gamma B i ħ S_z ) = (i * i) gamma B S_z = - gamma B S_z\n\nSimilarly, dS_y/dt = (i/ħ)[H, S_y] = (i/ħ)( - gamma B [S_y, S_y] ) = 0, since commutator of S_y with itself is zero.\n\nTherefore, the equations are:\n\ndS_z/dt = gamma B S_x\n\ndS_x/dt = - gamma B S_z\n\ndS_y/dt = 0\n\nThese are coupled differential equations. Let\'s write them as:\n\nd²S_z/dt² = gamma B dS_x/dt = gamma B (- gamma B S_z ) = - (gamma B)^2 S_z\n\nTherefore, the equation for S_z is:\n\nd²S_z/dt² + (gamma B)^2 S_z = 0\n\nThis is the equation for simple harmonic motion with angular frequency omega = gamma B. Therefore, the solution is S_z(t) = A cos(gamma B t) + B sin(gamma B t). The expectation value ⟨ S_z ⟩(t) will follow the same differential equation, leading to oscillations with angular frequency gamma B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\nThus, both methods—the Schrödinger picture time evolution and the Heisenberg picture equations of motion—lead to the conclusion that the oscillation frequency of ⟨ S_z ⟩ is gamma B. Therefore, the answer is gamma B.\n\nBut let me check once more for possible errors. The initial state is |+z⟩, and the Hamiltonian is along Y. The time evolution causes the spin to precess around the Y-axis. The precession frequency is given by the Larmor frequency, which is omega = gamma B. The projection of the spin onto the Z-axis will therefore oscillate sinusoidally with this frequency. Therefore, the oscillation frequency of ⟨ S_z ⟩ is indeed gamma B.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the Larmor frequency, which is gamma multiplied by the magnetic field B. Hence, the oscillation frequency is gamma B.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe oscillation frequency is \\boxed{\\gamma B}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745445376, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4183, prompt_tokens=968, total_tokens=5151, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment \(\mu = \gamma S_z\) initially aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. When the magnetic field is switched to +Y with the same magnitude \(B\), we need to determine the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's magnetic moment.

1. **Initial State and Hamiltonian**:
   - The initial state is \(|+z\rangle\), an eigenstate of \(S_z\).
   - The Hamiltonian changes from \(H_{\text{initial}} = -\gamma B S_z\) to \(H_{\text{final}} = -\gamma B S_y\).

2. **Time Evolution**:
   - The eigenstates of \(S_y\) are \(|+y\rangle = \frac{|+z\rangle + i|-z\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}\) and \(|-y\rangle = \frac{|+z\rangle - i|-z\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}\).
   - The initial state \(|+z\rangle\) is expressed in terms of \(|+y\rangle\) and \(|-y\rangle\): \(|+z\rangle = \frac{|+y\rangle + |-y\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}\).

3. **Time Evolution Under \(H_{\text{final}}\)**:
   - The time evolution operator is \(U(t) = \exp(-i H t / \hbar)\).
   - The state evolves as \(|\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \exp(i \gamma B t / 2) |+y\rangle + \exp(-i \gamma B t / 2) |-y\rangle \right)\).

4. **Expressing in Z-Basis**:
   - Converting back to the z-basis, the state becomes \(|\psi(t)\rangle = \cos(\gamma B t / 2) |+z\rangle - \sin(\gamma B t / 2) |-z\rangle\).

5. **Expectation Value of \(S_z\)**:
   - The expectation value \(\langle S_z \rangle(t)\) is calculated as \(\frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t)\).

6. **Oscillation Frequency**:
   - The argument of the cosine function \(\gamma B t\) indicates the angular frequency is \(\gamma B\).

Thus, the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s magnetic moment is \(\boxed{\gamma B}\).

But let's verify this through calculation.

The initial state is |+z⟩. Let's express this state in terms of the eigenstates of S_y. The eigenstates of S_y for spin-1/2 are |+y⟩ and |-y⟩, given by:

|+y⟩ = (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩)/√2

|-y⟩ = (|+z⟩ - i |-z⟩)/√2

Therefore, to express |+z⟩ in terms of |+y⟩ and |-y⟩, we can invert these equations. Let's solve for |+z⟩:

Adding |+y⟩ and |-y⟩:

|+y⟩ + |-y⟩ = [ (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩) + (|+z⟩ - i |-z⟩) ] / √2 = (2 |+z⟩ ) / √2 = √2 |+z⟩

Therefore, |+z⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |-y⟩)/√2

Similarly, subtracting them:

|+y⟩ - |-y⟩ = [ (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩) - (|+z⟩ - i |-z⟩) ] / √2 = (2i |-z⟩)/√2 = i √2 |-z⟩

Thus, |-z⟩ = (|+y⟩ - |-y⟩)/(i √2 )

But for our purposes, we have |+z⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |-y⟩)/√2

Therefore, the initial state is an equal superposition of |+y⟩ and |-y⟩. The time evolution under H_final = -gamma * B * S_y. Let's write the time evolution operator:

U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ ) = exp( i gamma B S_y t / ħ )

Because H = -gamma B S_y, so H t / ħ = -gamma B S_y t / ħ, hence the negative sign cancels when moving to the exponential.

Alternatively, H = ω S_y, where ω = -gamma B. So, U(t) = exp(-i ω S_y t / ħ )

But perhaps it's clearer to proceed with the given H.

Since |+y⟩ and |-y⟩ are eigenstates of S_y, their time evolution under H is straightforward. The state |+y⟩ has eigenvalue +ħ/2 for S_y, so under H = -gamma B S_y, the energy eigenvalue is E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2). Similarly, |-y⟩ has eigenvalue -ħ/2, so E_- = +gamma B (ħ/2).

Therefore, the time evolution of |+y⟩ is:

|+y⟩ → exp(-i E_+ t / ħ ) |+y⟩ = exp( i gamma B (ħ/2) t / ħ ) |+y⟩ = exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) |+y⟩

Similarly, |-y⟩ → exp(-i E_- t / ħ ) |-y⟩ = exp( -i gamma B (ħ/2) t / ħ ) |-y⟩ = exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) |-y⟩

Therefore, the initial state |+z⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |-y⟩)/√2 evolves as:

|psi(t)⟩ = [ exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) |+y⟩ + exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) |-y⟩ ] / √2

To compute ⟨ S_z ⟩(t), we need to find ⟨ psi(t) | S_z | psi(t) ⟩.

First, let's express S_z in terms of |+y⟩ and |-y⟩. Alternatively, we can express |psi(t)⟩ in terms of |+z⟩ and |-z⟩, since S_z is diagonal in that basis.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value by using the expansion of |psi(t)⟩ in the y-basis and then compute S_z in that basis.

Alternatively, since |+y⟩ and |-y⟩ can be written in terms of |+z⟩ and |-z⟩, we can express |psi(t)⟩ in the z-basis and then compute S_z.

Let me try the latter approach.

First, recall that |+y⟩ = (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩)/√2 and |-y⟩ = (|+z⟩ - i |-z⟩)/√2.

Therefore, substituting into |psi(t)⟩:

|psi(t)⟩ = [ exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩)/√2 + exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) (|+z⟩ - i |-z⟩)/√2 ] / √2

Simplify this expression:

Factor out 1/√2 from each term:

= [ exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩) + exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) (|+z⟩ - i |-z⟩) ] / (√2 * √2 )

= [ exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩) + exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) (|+z⟩ - i |-z⟩) ] / 2

Now, let's group the |+z⟩ and |-z⟩ terms:

= [ |+z⟩ ( exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) + exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) ) + i |-z⟩ ( exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) - exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) ) ] / 2

Using Euler's formula:

exp(iθ) + exp(-iθ) = 2 cosθ

exp(iθ) - exp(-iθ) = 2i sinθ

Therefore:

= [ |+z⟩ * 2 cos(gamma B t / 2 ) + i |-z⟩ * 2i sin(gamma B t / 2 ) ] / 2

Simplify:

= |+z⟩ cos(gamma B t / 2 ) + i^2 |-z⟩ sin(gamma B t / 2 )

Since i^2 = -1:

= |+z⟩ cos(gamma B t / 2 ) - |-z⟩ sin(gamma B t / 2 )

Therefore, the time-evolved state is:

|psi(t)⟩ = cos(gamma B t / 2 ) |+z⟩ - sin(gamma B t / 2 ) |-z⟩

Now, to compute ⟨ S_z ⟩(t), we can use this expression. The operator S_z in the z-basis has eigenvalues +ħ/2 for |+z⟩ and -ħ/2 for |-z⟩. Therefore, the expectation value is:

⟨ S_z ⟩(t) = |⟨+z | psi(t)⟩|^2 (ħ/2) + |⟨-z | psi(t)⟩|^2 (-ħ/2 )

But since |psi(t)⟩ is expressed as a combination of |+z⟩ and |-z⟩, the coefficients squared give the probabilities. Alternatively, since the state is:

|psi(t)⟩ = cos(theta) |+z⟩ - sin(theta) |-z⟩, where theta = gamma B t / 2

Then, the expectation value is:

⟨ S_z ⟩(t) = |cos(theta)|^2 (ħ/2) + |sin(theta)|^2 (-ħ/2 )

= [ cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ] (ħ/2 )

= cos(2 theta) (ħ/2 )

Substituting theta = gamma B t / 2:

⟨ S_z ⟩(t) = cos(gamma B t) * (ħ/2 )

Therefore, the expectation value of S_z oscillates as cos(gamma B t) multiplied by ħ/2. The oscillation frequency is the coefficient of t in the cosine argument, which is gamma B. Therefore, the frequency is gamma B divided by 2π to convert angular frequency to regular frequency. Wait, but in physics, when we talk about oscillation frequency in terms of angular frequency (omega), we often just refer to omega as the frequency. However, the problem states "oscillation frequency," which could be either the angular frequency (radians per second) or the regular frequency (cycles per second, Hz). The problem doesn't specify, but in quantum mechanics contexts, when dealing with expectation values oscillating as cos(omega t), the omega is the angular frequency. However, the problem might just be expecting the angular frequency. Let me check.

The problem says "oscillation frequency," which in standard terms is cycles per second (Hz), which is omega/(2π). But in physics, especially in quantum mechanics, sometimes people refer to angular frequency as just frequency. Let me check the problem again. The problem says "average of the z-component of the particle’s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?" The key is that the expectation value is proportional to cos(gamma B t), so the angular frequency is gamma B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency in radians per second is gamma B. If they want the frequency in Hz, it's gamma B / (2π). But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we need to check the units. The problem states that mu = gamma S_z. The magnetic moment mu has units of J/T. S_z is in units of ħ (since spin is in units of ħ). Therefore, gamma must have units of (J/T)/ (J·s) ) = 1/(T·s). Wait, let me check:

Wait, S_z is dimensionless in some unit systems, but actually, spin is measured in units of ħ. So S_z is in ħ units. Therefore, mu = gamma * S_z, so gamma has units of (J/T) / (ħ). Since ħ has units of J·s, gamma has units of (J/T)/(J·s) ) = 1/(T·s). Then, gamma * B (where B is in T) gives units of 1/s, which is angular frequency (rad/s). Therefore, the angular frequency is omega = gamma B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency in radians per second is gamma B, and in Hz, it's gamma B / (2π). But the problem says "oscillation frequency," which is ambiguous. However, in the context of quantum mechanics, when you have an expression like cos(omega t), omega is the angular frequency. However, the problem might be expecting the answer in terms of the Larmor frequency, which is omega = gamma B, which is angular frequency. But let's check the standard approach.

The Larmor frequency is given by omega = gamma B, which is the angular frequency. The oscillation frequency of the expectation value would be this angular frequency. However, in the expression we derived, ⟨ S_z ⟩(t) = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t), so the argument of the cosine is gamma B t, so the angular frequency is gamma B, and the regular frequency is gamma B / (2π). But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we need to answer with the angular frequency. However, in many contexts, when someone refers to "frequency" without specifying, they might mean the angular frequency. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is gamma B / (2π). But let's check the problem again.

Wait, the problem says "the average of the z-component of the particle’s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?" The average is ⟨ mu_z ⟩ = gamma ⟨ S_z ⟩. From our calculation, ⟨ S_z ⟩(t) = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t), so ⟨ mu_z ⟩(t) = gamma (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t). Therefore, the oscillation of ⟨ mu_z ⟩ is at angular frequency gamma B. Therefore, the frequency is gamma B / (2π) if they want cycles per second, but the problem might just want the angular frequency. However, in quantum mechanics, when we talk about transition frequencies or oscillation frequencies in expectation values, we usually refer to the angular frequency. For example, Rabi oscillations have a frequency given by the Rabi frequency, which is an angular frequency. Therefore, the answer is likely gamma B. However, let's check the standard formula for spin precession.

When a magnetic moment is placed in a magnetic field, it precesses around the field with the Larmor frequency, which is omega = gamma B. The precession frequency is omega = gamma B. In this case, the magnetic field is along Y, so the spin precesses around Y, causing the z-component to oscillate. The frequency of this oscillation is the Larmor frequency, which is gamma B. Therefore, the answer is gamma B. However, in our calculation, we found ⟨ S_z ⟩(t) = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t), so the angular frequency is gamma B, which matches the Larmor frequency. Therefore, the oscillation frequency is gamma B. Hence, the answer is gamma B. But let me confirm once more.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B S_y, so the energy levels are E = ± (gamma B ħ / 2). The energy difference is delta E = gamma B ħ. The oscillation frequency in transitions between these states would be delta E / ħ = gamma B. Therefore, the Rabi frequency is gamma B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency of the expectation value is gamma B. Therefore, the answer is gamma B.

But let me check with another approach. Suppose we use the Heisenberg picture. The time evolution of S_z is governed by the Heisenberg equation:

dS_z/dt = (i/ħ)[H, S_z]

Given H = - gamma B S_y, so:

dS_z/dt = (i/ħ)( - gamma B [S_y, S_z] )

The commutator [S_y, S_z] = i ħ S_x (using the commutation relations [S_i, S_j] = i ħ ε_{ijk} S_k )

Therefore:

dS_z/dt = (i/ħ)( - gamma B (i ħ S_x ) ) = (i/ħ)( - gamma B i ħ S_x ) = (i * i)( - gamma B S_x ) = (-1)( - gamma B S_x ) = gamma B S_x

Similarly, we can write the Heisenberg equations for S_x and S_y. However, since we are interested in S_z, let's proceed.

So, dS_z/dt = gamma B S_x

Similarly, we can compute dS_x/dt:

dS_x/dt = (i/ħ)[H, S_x] = (i/ħ)( - gamma B [S_y, S_x] )

[S_y, S_x] = - [S_x, S_y] = -i ħ S_z

Therefore:

dS_x/dt = (i/ħ)( - gamma B ( -i ħ S_z ) ) = (i/ħ)( gamma B i ħ S_z ) = (i * i) gamma B S_z = - gamma B S_z

Similarly, dS_y/dt = (i/ħ)[H, S_y] = (i/ħ)( - gamma B [S_y, S_y] ) = 0, since commutator of S_y with itself is zero.

Therefore, the equations are:

dS_z/dt = gamma B S_x

dS_x/dt = - gamma B S_z

dS_y/dt = 0

These are coupled differential equations. Let's write them as:

d²S_z/dt² = gamma B dS_x/dt = gamma B (- gamma B S_z ) = - (gamma B)^2 S_z

Therefore, the equation for S_z is:

d²S_z/dt² + (gamma B)^2 S_z = 0

This is the equation for simple harmonic motion with angular frequency omega = gamma B. Therefore, the solution is S_z(t) = A cos(gamma B t) + B sin(gamma B t). The expectation value ⟨ S_z ⟩(t) will follow the same differential equation, leading to oscillations with angular frequency gamma B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

Thus, both methods—the Schrödinger picture time evolution and the Heisenberg picture equations of motion—lead to the conclusion that the oscillation frequency of ⟨ S_z ⟩ is gamma B. Therefore, the answer is gamma B.

But let me check once more for possible errors. The initial state is |+z⟩, and the Hamiltonian is along Y. The time evolution causes the spin to precess around the Y-axis. The precession frequency is given by the Larmor frequency, which is omega = gamma B. The projection of the spin onto the Z-axis will therefore oscillate sinusoidally with this frequency. Therefore, the oscillation frequency of ⟨ S_z ⟩ is indeed gamma B.

Therefore, the answer is the Larmor frequency, which is gamma multiplied by the magnetic field B. Hence, the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

**Final Answer**
The oscillation frequency is \boxed{\gamma B}.
