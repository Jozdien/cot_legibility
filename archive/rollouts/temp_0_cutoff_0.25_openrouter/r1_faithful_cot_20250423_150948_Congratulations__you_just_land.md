To express and purify the Human p53 protein in *E. coli* BL21 efficiently, the ideal plasmid must address **codon usage**, **promoter compatibility**, **purification tags**, and **selection markers**. Here's the breakdown:

### Key Features of the Correct Plasmid:
1. **Promoter Compatibility**:
   - The plasmid should use a **T7 promoter** (e.g., pET vector) paired with *E. coli* BL21(DE3), which supplies T7 RNA polymerase for induction with IPTG. While the question specifies "BL21," it is common practice to assume BL21(DE3) for T7-driven expression. If the plasmid uses a non-T7 promoter (e.g., **tac** or **trc**), it would work in standard BL21, but T7 systems are more standard for high-yield expression.

2. **Codon Optimization**:
   - The p53 gene must be **codon-optimized** for *E. coli* to avoid rare codons that hinder translation efficiency.

3. **Purification Tag**:
   - A **6xHis-tag** (usually N-terminal) is essential for rapid purification via immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). The provided p53 sequence lacks a tag, so the plasmid must include one. For native p53, a **cleavable tag** (e.g., TEV protease site after the His-tag) would allow tag removal post-purification, though this adds a step. If speed is prioritized, the tag may remain attached.

4. **Selection Marker**:
   - **Ampicillin resistance** (or another antibiotic marker) for plasmid maintenance.

### Why Other Plasmids Are Less Suitable:
- Plasmids lacking **codon optimization** would result in poor expression.
- Plasmids with weak or incompatible promoters (e.g., eukaryotic promoters) would fail in *E. coli*.
- Plasmids without a **His-tag** would complicate purification, requiring slower methods like ion-exchange chromatography.

### Final Answer:
The correct plasmid is **a pET-derived vector (T7 promoter) with a codon-optimized p53 gene, an N-terminal 6xHis-tag, and ampicillin resistance**. This setup assumes the use of BL21(DE3) for T7-driven expression, enabling high-yield production and rapid purification. If the plasmid uses a non-T7 promoter (e.g., tac), ensure BL21 is compatible with the promoter system.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I just started this job at a top structural biology lab at Stanford, and my first task is to produce and purify the Human p53 protein in E. coli BL21. The PI gave me the amino acid sequence of p53 and four plasmids with different sequences. I need to figure out which plasmid to use. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that E. coli is a commonly used prokaryotic system for protein expression. But to express a eukaryotic protein like human p53 in E. coli, there are some considerations. The main issues might be codon usage bias, presence of a suitable promoter, selection markers, and maybe fusion tags for purification.

Looking at the amino acid sequence, the first thing I notice is that it's the full-length p53 protein. p53 is a tumor suppressor protein, and I think it's a relatively large protein. E. coli might have trouble expressing it properly, especially if there are post-translational modifications or if the protein tends to form inclusion bodies. But the question is about choosing the right plasmid, so maybe the plasmid addresses these issues.

Plasmids used for protein expression in E. coli typically have certain elements: an origin of replication compatible with E. coli (like ColE1), a selectable marker (like ampicillin resistance), a promoter (like T7, lac, or tac promoter), a multiple cloning site (MCS) where the gene of interest is inserted, and possibly a fusion tag (like His-tag, GST, or MBP) to aid in purification. Also, if the promoter is inducible (like with IPTG), that's important for controlling expression.

Since the question mentions E. coli BL21, I recall that BL21 strains are typically used for protein expression because they lack the lon protease and are deficient in the ompT protease, which helps prevent protein degradation. Also, BL21(DE3) has the T7 RNA polymerase under the control of the lacUV5 promoter, which is induced by IPTG. So if the plasmid uses a T7 promoter, then BL21(DE3) would be needed. But the question just says BL21, not DE3. Wait, maybe the plasmid includes the T7 RNA polymerase? Or maybe the plasmid uses a different promoter that doesn't require T7 RNA polymerase, like the lac or tac promoter. Hmm, but BL21 doesn't have the T7 RNA polymerase unless it's DE3. So if the plasmid has a T7 promoter, then the host must be BL21(DE3). But the question says BL21, so maybe the plasmid doesn't require T7? Or maybe one of the plasmids includes the T7 RNA polymerase gene? That seems less likely. Alternatively, maybe the plasmid uses a different promoter compatible with BL21.

Another thing is codon usage. Human genes might have codons that are rare in E. coli, leading to inefficient translation. So the plasmid might have a feature that addresses this, like codon optimization of the p53 gene for E. coli or the presence of tRNA genes for rare codons. Some plasmids, like those in the pET series (which use T7 promoters), might require additional tRNA genes (like Rosetta strains) if the target gene has rare codons. But BL21 doesn't supply those tRNAs, so if the p53 gene has a lot of rare codons for E. coli, the plasmid might need to include those or the strain should be a variant that provides them. However, the question doesn't mention the strain being modified, just BL21. So maybe the correct plasmid has a codon-optimized p53 gene.

Also, for purification, the plasmid might include a tag like a His-tag (6xHis) which allows purification using nickel affinity chromatography. The amino acid sequence provided doesn't have a His-tag, but maybe the plasmid adds it as a fusion. Alternatively, the tag could be cleavable with a protease later. The question says "purify as quickly as possible," so maybe a His-tag is present for IMAC (immobilized metal affinity chromatography), which is a common and quick method.

Putting this together, the ideal plasmid should have:

1. A promoter compatible with E. coli BL21. If it's a T7 promoter, then the host should be BL21(DE3). But since the host is BL21, maybe the plasmid uses a different promoter, like the lac or tac promoter, which are induced by IPTG and use the E. coli RNA polymerase. Alternatively, the plasmid might include the T7 RNA polymerase under an inducible promoter, but that's more complex.

2. A selectable marker, like ampicillin resistance.

3. Codon-optimized p53 gene for E. coli.

4. A His-tag or other affinity tag for purification.

Looking at the four plasmids (though their sequences aren't provided), the correct one should have these features. Since the question gives four options, I need to infer based on common plasmid features.

Wait, but the user hasn't provided the four plasmid sequences. Oh, wait, the question says "You are given 4 plasmids containing 4 different sequences, which one are you going to use?" But the user only provided the amino acid sequence of p53. Maybe the answer is inferred from standard plasmid features used for expressing human proteins in E. coli.

Alternatively, perhaps the plasmids differ in the presence of a T7 promoter, origin of replication, tags, or other elements. Since the amino acid sequence doesn't include a tag, but the plasmid might add it. For example, a plasmid that has the p53 gene cloned into a pET vector (which uses T7 promoter) with a His-tag. But BL21 requires DE3 for T7 expression. If the plasmid is a pET vector, then the host should be BL21(DE3). But the question says BL21, not DE3. So maybe the plasmid uses a different promoter.

Alternatively, maybe the plasmid has a tac promoter (a hybrid of trp and lac promoters), which is induced by IPTG and uses the E. coli RNA polymerase. In that case, BL21 (which has the lacUV5 promoter for T7 in DE3 strains) but without DE3 would still have the normal lac operon components. Wait, the tac promoter is stronger and is regulated by the lac repressor (LacI). So if the plasmid has a tac promoter and a LacI gene (to repress basal expression), then induction with IPTG would work in BL21.

Additionally, the plasmid should have a ribosome binding site (RBS) appropriate for E. coli, and the p53 gene should be codon-optimized. Also, a His-tag, maybe at the N- or C-terminus, for purification.

So among the four plasmids, the correct one would be the one with:

- tac promoter (or other E. coli compatible promoter)

- ampicillin resistance (common selection marker)

- His-tag fused to p53

- codon-optimized p53 gene

But since the amino acid sequence provided doesn't show a His-tag, the plasmid must include it as a fusion. The given p53 sequence starts with MEEPQ..., so if the plasmid adds a His-tag, it would be before or after this sequence. For example, an N-terminal His-tag would add MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSH... before the initial methionine. But the initial methionine is part of the p53 sequence, so maybe the His-tag is added at the N-terminus, making the protein start with the His-tag followed by the p53 sequence.

Therefore, the correct plasmid should have the p53 gene with an added His-tag, under a promoter compatible with E. coli BL21 (like tac), with a selection marker, and codon-optimized.

Alternatively, if the plasmid uses a T7 promoter and the host is BL21(DE3), but the question says BL21. Maybe the PI just said BL21, assuming it's DE3? Sometimes people refer to BL21(DE3) as BL21 for short. But strictly, BL21 doesn't have T7 RNA polymerase. So if the plasmid is a pET vector (T7 promoter), then the host must be BL21(DE3). If the host is just BL21, then the plasmid can't use a T7 promoter. So this is a possible point of confusion.

But the question says "E. coli BL21", so unless specified as DE3, it's regular BL21. Therefore, the plasmid must use a promoter that doesn't require T7 RNA polymerase. So promoters like lac, tac, or trc.

Another consideration is whether the plasmid includes a secretion signal. But for cytoplasmic expression in E. coli, which is typical, the protein would be expressed in the cytoplasm, possibly forming inclusion bodies. If the plasmid includes a secretion signal, the protein would be directed to the periplasm, but p53 is a nuclear protein in humans, and secretion might not be desired. So likely cytoplasmic expression.

Also, the plasmid should have a strong RBS to ensure high expression.

Putting all together, the correct plasmid would have:

- tac promoter (or similar) for induction with IPTG in BL21.

- Ampicillin resistance.

- His-tag fused to p53 for purification.

- Codon-optimized p53 gene.

So among the four options, the plasmid with these features is the right choice. Since the user hasn't provided the actual plasmid sequences, but this is a hypothetical question, the answer would be the plasmid that includes a T7 promoter (if using BL21 DE3) or a tac promoter (if using regular BL21), along with a His-tag and codon optimization.

But since the strain is BL21 (not DE3), the plasmid must use a promoter that doesn't require T7 RNA polymerase. Therefore, the correct plasmid would have a tac promoter, a His-tag, and codon-optimized p53.

Alternatively, maybe the plasmid is a pET vector with a T7 promoter, and the host is BL21(DE3), but the question says BL21. Maybe it's a trick question where the correct answer is the plasmid with the T7 promoter and His-tag, assuming that the host is actually BL21(DE3) even though it's just called BL21. Sometimes in labs, people might refer to BL21(DE3) as BL21 for simplicity.

Another angle: the p53 protein has a molecular weight of around 43 kDa (based on 393 amino acids). Expression in E. coli might lead to inclusion bodies, so maybe the plasmid includes a solubility tag like GST or MBP. But the question says to purify as quickly as possible, so a His-tag is faster than a GST tag which requires glutathione columns. His-tag purification is standard and quick.

Also, the presence of a protease cleavage site (like TEV protease) to remove the tag if needed. But the question emphasizes speed, so maybe the tag is left on, or the plasmid doesn't include a cleavage site. However, the given amino acid sequence doesn't have a His-tag, so the plasmid must add it, but the final protein after purification (if the tag is cleaved) would match the given sequence. But the question says "purify as quickly as possible the Human P53 protein" as per the given sequence, which doesn't include a tag. Therefore, the plasmid must include a cleavable tag. But cleavage adds steps, which might slow things down. Alternatively, maybe the tag is at the N-terminus and doesn't interfere with function, so they might keep it. But the question specifies the amino acid sequence, which starts with MEEPQ..., so if the plasmid adds a His-tag, the actual expressed protein would have the His-tag before MEEPQ..., but the desired product is the native sequence. Therefore, the plasmid must include a cleavable tag. For example, a His-tag followed by a TEV protease site. Then after purification, you cleave with TEV to get rid of the tag. But that adds an extra step. However, the question says "as quickly as possible," so maybe they just want the His-tag and the protein is used with the tag. But the given sequence doesn't have it, so that's conflicting.

Wait, maybe the amino acid sequence provided is the native sequence, and the plasmid includes a His-tag that's not in the native sequence. So the expressed protein would have the His-tag, but the question says to produce the Human P53 protein as per the given sequence. Therefore, the His-tag must be removed. But that requires a cleavage step. Alternatively, maybe the plasmid doesn't add a tag, and purification is done via another method. But without a tag, purification is harder. Common tags are His, GST, FLAG, etc. Without a tag, you'd have to use other methods like ion exchange, size exclusion, etc., which are more time-consuming. So to purify quickly, a His-tag is ideal.

Therefore, the plasmid must include a His-tag that's added to the p53 sequence, which is then cleaved off after purification. But the given amino acid sequence is the mature protein, so the plasmid's construct should allow for that. Therefore, the plasmid would have the p53 gene with an N-terminal His-tag followed by a protease cleavage site (like TEV), so that after purification, the tag can be removed, leaving the native sequence. However, this adds steps. If time is a priority, maybe they just want the His-tag and the protein is used with the tag. But the question specifies the amino acid sequence of the protein, which doesn't include the tag. Therefore, the correct plasmid must include a cleavage site.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe the question is simpler, and the correct answer is the plasmid that has the p53 gene under a T7 promoter with a His-tag, assuming the host is BL21(DE3). Since the question mentions BL21, perhaps the correct plasmid is a pET vector (which uses T7) and the host is actually BL21(DE3), even if not specified. Alternatively, the plasmid includes the T7 RNA polymerase under an inducible promoter, but that's uncommon.

Alternatively, maybe the plasmid uses a different promoter system. For example, the pBAD promoter (arabinose-inducible) or pTrc (trc promoter, IPTG-inducible). These don't require T7 RNA polymerase.

In summary, without knowing the exact plasmid sequences, the most likely answer is the plasmid that contains the p53 gene codon-optimized for E. coli, under an inducible promoter (like T7 with BL21(DE3) or tac with BL21), and includes a His-tag for purification. Since the question emphasizes speed, the His-tag is crucial for quick purification via IMAC.

Therefore, the correct plasmid is the one that has:

- Codon-optimized p53 gene.

- Inducible promoter compatible with E. coli BL21 (T7 if DE3 is implied, or tac otherwise).

- His-tag for purification.

- Appropriate antibiotic resistance (like ampicillin).

Assuming that the plasmids differ in these features, the one with all the above would be correct. Since the user hasn't provided the four options, but this is a standard question, the answer is likely the plasmid with a T7 promoter and His-tag, assuming BL21(DE3) is used, even if not explicitly stated. But since the question specifies BL21, maybe it's a trick, and the correct plasmid uses a different promoter. However, in many cases, BL21 is used with DE3 for T7 expression, so maybe that's acceptable.

Another point: the p53 protein is a transcription factor and may be toxic to E. coli when expressed. Therefore, the plasmid should have tight regulation of expression, like using a T7 promoter with a lac operator and a compatible strain with T7 RNA polymerase under IPTG control. This way, expression is induced only when IPTG is added, preventing toxicity before induction.

In conclusion, the plasmid should be a pET vector (with T7 promoter, His-tag) and the host should be BL21(DE3). But since the host is given as BL21, perhaps the answer expects the plasmid to include the T7 RNA polymerase, which is unlikely. Alternatively, the question assumes BL21(DE3) is intended. Given that, the correct plasmid is the pET-based one with His-tag.

# Anthropic completion

I recently began working at a prestigious structural biology laboratory at Stanford, and my initial assignment involves producing and purifying Human p53 protein using E. coli BL21. The Principal Investigator has provided me with the amino acid sequence of p53 along with four plasmids containing different sequences. My task is to determine which plasmid is appropriate for this work. I'll analyze this methodically.

E. coli is a widely utilized prokaryotic system for protein expression. However, expressing a eukaryotic protein like human p53 in E. coli requires addressing several factors: codon usage bias, appropriate promoter selection, selection markers, and possibly fusion tags for purification purposes.

Upon examining the amino acid sequence, I observe it represents the complete p53 protein. As a tumor suppressor, p53 is relatively large, which might present challenges for proper expression in E. coli, particularly regarding post-translational modifications or potential inclusion body formation. However, since my focus is on plasmid selection, perhaps these issues are addressed in the plasmid design.

Typical E. coli expression plasmids contain several key components: an E. coli-compatible replication origin (such as ColE1), a selectable marker (like ampicillin resistance), a promoter (such as T7, lac, or tac), a multiple cloning site for gene insertion, and potentially a fusion tag (such as His-tag, GST, or MBP) to facilitate purification. Inducible promoters, like those responsive to IPTG, are valuable for expression control.

The specification of E. coli BL21 is noteworthy. BL21 strains are favored for protein expression due to their lack of lon protease and ompT protease deficiency, which helps prevent protein degradation. BL21(DE3) strains contain T7 RNA polymerase under lacUV5 promoter control, which IPTG can induce. If the plasmid utilizes a T7 promoter, BL21(DE3) would be necessary. Since the strain is specified as BL21 without the DE3 designation, either the plasmid doesn't require T7 RNA polymerase, or it somehow provides this component, though the latter seems unlikely. Alternatively, the plasmid might employ a promoter compatible with standard BL21.

Codon usage is another critical consideration. Human genes often contain codons that are rare in E. coli, potentially leading to inefficient translation. The ideal plasmid might address this through codon optimization of the p53 gene for E. coli expression or by including rare codon tRNA genes. While some plasmids like those in the pET series might require additional tRNA genes if the target gene contains rare codons, standard BL21 doesn't provide these tRNAs. Therefore, if p53 contains numerous E. coli rare codons, the correct plasmid might feature a codon-optimized version of the gene.

For purification purposes, the plasmid might incorporate a tag such as a His-tag, enabling purification via nickel affinity chromatography. While the provided amino acid sequence doesn't include a His-tag, the plasmid might add this as a fusion. Alternatively, the tag could be removable via protease treatment. Given the requirement to "purify as quickly as possible," the presence of a His-tag for IMAC would be advantageous.

I recently started a position at a leading structural biology lab at Stanford, and my initial assignment is to produce and purify the Human p53 protein using E. coli BL21. The principal investigator provided me with the amino acid sequence of p53 and four plasmids with different sequences, and my task is to determine which plasmid to use. I'll need to think this through carefully.

Firstly, I remember that E. coli is a widely used prokaryotic system for protein expression. However, expressing a eukaryotic protein like human p53 in E. coli requires some considerations. The primary concerns might include codon usage bias, the availability of a suitable promoter, selection markers, and possibly fusion tags for purification.

Examining the amino acid sequence, I immediately see that it is the full-length p53 protein. Being a tumor suppressor, p53 is relatively large, which might present challenges for proper expression in E. coli, particularly if there are post-translational modifications or a tendency for the protein to form inclusion bodies. Nonetheless, my main task is identifying the right plasmid, which might already account for these issues.

Plasmids designed for protein expression in E. coli generally include specific elements: an origin of replication compatible with E. coli (such as ColE1), a selectable marker (like ampicillin resistance), a promoter (such as T7, lac, or tac), a multiple cloning site (MCS) where the target gene is inserted, and possibly a fusion tag (like His-tag, GST, or MBP) for purification. Moreover, if the promoter is inducible with IPTG, that plays a crucial role in controlling expression.

Given the reference to E. coli BL21, I recall that BL21 strains are often used for protein expression because they don't have the lon protease and are deficient in the ompT protease, minimizing protein degradation. Also, BL21(DE3) has the T7 RNA polymerase under the lacUV5 promoter, induced by IPTG. If the plasmid uses a T7 promoter, then BL21(DE3) would be necessary. But the task specifies BL21, not DE3. So, perhaps the plasmid has a different promoter that doesn't need T7 RNA polymerase or includes the T7 RNA polymerase gene itself, which seems unlikely. Most likely, the plasmid employs a different promoter that works with BL21.

Additionally, there's the issue of codon usage. Human genes can contain codons that are rare in E. coli, resulting in inefficient translation. Therefore, the plasmid might accommodate this with features like codon optimization for E. coli or the inclusion of tRNA genes for rare codons. Some plasmids from the pET series requiring T7 promoters might need additional tRNA genes (like Rosetta strains) if rare codons are present. However, BL21 doesn’t supply these tRNAs, so if the p53 gene has many rare codons, the plasmid might need to include them, or the strain should be a variant that does. Since the task only mentions BL21, the correct plasmid could have a codon-optimized p53 gene.

For purification, the plasmid might contain a His-tag that allows purification via nickel affinity chromatography. Although the provided sequence lacks a His-tag, the plasmid could add it as a fusion, possibly cleavable with a protease later on. As the task requires "purify as quickly as possible," it is likely a His-tag is involved for IMAC purification.

The user didn\'t mention any tags, but the question is about purifying quickly, so the presence of a His-tag in the plasmid\'s construct is likely.\n\nSo the correct plasmid would be one that has the p53 gene with a His-tag (maybe 6xHis) under a strong inducible promoter (like T7 with a compatible host, or another promoter), codon-optimized for E. coli, and the necessary elements for selection and replication.\n\nNow, the four plasmids have different sequences.

Alternatively, maybe the plasmid includes the T7 RNA polymerase under a different promoter. But that\'s not typical. So if the plasmid is pET, then the host needs to be DE3. Since the host is BL21, perhaps the correct plasmid uses a promoter that BL21 can use, like the tac promoter (which is IPTG-inducible and uses the E. coli RNA polymerase). So a plasmid with tac promoter, His-tag, amp resistance, and codon-optimized p53 would be ideal.\n\nAlternatively, if the plasmid is pET and the host is BL21(DE3), but the question just says BL21.

The most common system for high-level protein expression in E. coli is the pET system, which uses T7 promoters and requires T7 RNA polymerase (provided in BL21(DE3)). So if the plasmid is a pET vector with the p53 gene cloned with an N-terminal or C-terminal His-tag, that would be ideal. The His-tag allows for quick purification via nickel columns.

Therefore, using an inducible promoter is essential. The T7 system is tightly regulated, which is good for toxic proteins. So even if BL21 is not DE3, but the plasmid has a T7 promoter and the T7 RNA polymerase under an inducible promoter, that could work. Wait, but that\'s not typical. Usually, the T7 RNA polymerase is in the host genome under a lacUV5 promoter (as in DE3 strains). So without DE3, the plasmid can\'t provide T7 RNA polymerase unless it\'s cloned into the plasmid, which is not common.\n\nTherefore, if the host is BL21 (not DE3), then the plasmid must use a promoter that E. coli RNA polymerase can recognize, like the tac promoter. So a plasmid with tac promoter, His-tag, and amp resistance would be suitable. For example, pKK223-3 is a vector with the tac promoter. Alternatively, pGEX uses the tac promoter and has a GST tag, but the question mentions purifying as quickly as possible, and His-tags are quicker because they don\'t require cleavage (though sometimes you might want to cleave, but the question says "as quickly as possible," so maybe a His-tag is better).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the plasmid is pRSET which has a T7 promoter and a His-tag, but again requires T7 RNA polymerase.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but considering that BL21 is often used with DE3 for T7 expression, and the pET system is the most common, I think the correct answer is the plasmid that has the T7 promoter, His-tag, and amp resistance, assuming the host is BL21(DE3). However, the question states BL21, not DE3. This is a possible point of confusion. If the plasmid is designed for BL21 (without DE3), then it can\'t use T7.

The T7 promoter is for expression, but without T7 RNA polymerase, the gene won\'t be expressed. So if the host is BL21 (not DE3), then the T7 promoter won\'t work. Therefore, the plasmid must use a promoter that E. coli RNA polymerase can recognize. The tac promoter is a strong hybrid promoter that is IPTG-inducible. So a plasmid with the tac promoter, a His-tag, and the p53 gene codon-optimized would be the right choice.\n\nIn that case, the plasmid would be something like pMAL (which has a tac promoter but also a maltose-binding protein tag) or a custom plasmid with tac promoter and His-tag.

To produce and purify the Human p53 protein in *E. coli* BL21, the optimal plasmid must address **codon usage**, **promoter compatibility**, **selection markers**, and **purification tags**. Here's the breakdown:

### Key Considerations:
1. **Promoter Compatibility**:
   - BL21 lacks T7 RNA polymerase unless it is a DE3 variant. If the plasmid uses a **T7 promoter** (e.g., pET vectors), the host must be BL21(DE3). If the question assumes BL21 (non-DE3), the plasmid should use an **E. coli RNA polymerase-dependent promoter** (e.g., *tac* or *trc*).

2. **Codon Optimization**:
   - Human p53 likely contains rare codons for *E. coli*. The plasmid should include **codon-optimized sequences** or supply rare tRNA genes (e.g., pRARE in Rosetta strains). However, BL21 lacks these tRNAs, so codon optimization in the plasmid is critical.

3. **Purification Tag**:
   - A **His-tag** (6xHis) enables rapid purification via immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). The provided p53 sequence lacks a tag, so the plasmid must include one (N- or C-terminal).

4. **Inducible Expression**:
   - Tight regulation (e.g., IPTG-inducible *lac*/*tac* promoters) is essential for expressing potentially toxic proteins like p53.

---

### Likely Plasmid Features:
- **Promoter**: *T7* (if BL21 is DE3) or *tac/trc* (if standard BL21).
- **Tag**: **His-tag** for quick purification.
- **Selection**: Ampicillin resistance (common in expression vectors).
- **Codon Usage**: Optimized for *E. coli*.

---

### Conclusion:
Assuming the lab uses **BL21(DE3)** (a common oversight in terminology), the best plasmid is a **pET-derived vector** (e.g., pET-28a) with:
- **T7 promoter** for high expression.
- **His-tag** for IMAC purification.
- **Codon-optimized p53 gene**.

If BL21 is non-DE3, a plasmid with a **tac/trc promoter** (e.g., pTrcHis) and His-tag would be ideal. Given standard practices, the **pET system with BL21(DE3)** is the most likely answer.

iy chromatography), which is a common and quick method.

So putting this together, the correct plasmid should have:

1. A promoter compatible with E. coli BL21. If it's a T7 promoter, then the host should be BL21(DE3), but if the plasmid has a different promoter (like the lac or tac promoter), then regular BL21 could work. Wait, but the tac promoter is a hybrid of trp and lac, and is induced by IPTG. The lacUV5 promoter is in BL21(DE3). Hmm, maybe the plasmid uses a T7 promoter and the host is BL21(DE3), but the question says "BL21" without specifying. Maybe the plasmid includes the T7 RNA polymerase under an inducible promoter? That's possible but less common. Alternatively, maybe the plasmid uses a promoter that doesn't require T7, like the pLac or pTac. But I need to check.

2. The plasmid should have a selectable marker, like ampicillin resistance.

3. The plasmid should have the p53 gene, possibly codon-optimized for E. coli.

4. The plasmid might include a His-tag or other affinity tag for purification.

Now, looking at the amino acid sequence of p53 provided, the N-terminal starts with MEEPQ... and the C-terminal ends with ...PDSD. There's no His-tag in the given sequence, so if the plasmid adds a His-tag, it would be either at the N-terminus or C-terminus. The user didn't mention any tags, but the question is about purifying quickly, so the presence of a His-tag in the plasmid's construct is likely.

So the correct plasmid would be one that has the p53 gene with a His-tag (maybe 6xHis) under a strong inducible promoter (like T7 with a compatible host, or another promoter), codon-optimized for E. coli, and the necessary elements for selection and replication.

Now, the four plasmids have different sequences. The answer options aren't provided, but since this is a hypothetical question, the key factors are the promoter, presence of His-tag, codon usage, and selection marker.

Assuming the four plasmids are variations of common expression vectors:

- Plasmid 1: pET vector with T7 promoter, amp resistance, and His-tag. Requires BL21(DE3).
- Plasmid 2: pGEX with GST tag, tac promoter, amp resistance.
- Plasmid 3: pBAD with arabinose-inducible promoter, His-tag.
- Plasmid 4: pUC vector with lac promoter, amp resistance, no tag.

Given that the host is E. coli BL21 (not DE3), if the plasmid uses a T7 promoter (like pET), then BL21 without DE3 can't express T7 RNA polymerase, so that plasmid wouldn't work. Therefore, if the plasmid uses a T7 promoter, the host must be DE3. But the question states BL21, so maybe the plasmid uses a different promoter.

So a plasmid with tac promoter, His-tag, amp resistance, and codon-optimized p53 would be ideal.

Alternatively, if the plasmid is pET and the host is BL21(DE3), but the question just says BL21. Maybe the PI assumes that BL21 is DE3? Sometimes people refer to BL21(DE3) as BL21 for simplicity. If that's the case, then pET with T7 promoter and His-tag would be the way to go.

Alternatively, maybe the plasmid is pRSET which has a T7 promoter and a His-tag, but again requires T7 RNA polymerase.

4. **Selection Marker and Origin**:
   - Standard markers (e.g., **ampicillin** or **kanamycin resistance**) and a high-copy origin (e.g., **ColE1**) ensure plasmid maintenance and yield.

### Why BL21 (Non-DE3) Matters:
- BL21 lacks the T7 RNA polymerase gene, so plasmids relying on **T7 promoters (e.g., pET vectors)** are incompatible unless the plasmid encodes T7 polymerase (uncommon). Thus, the plasmid must use a native *E. coli* promoter.

### Likely Plasmid Features:

  - **pQE series** (e.g., pQE-30): Uses a T5 promoter (IPTG-inducible), includes a His-tag, and is compatible with BL21.
  - **pGEX or pMAL**: Use tac promoters and fusion tags (GST/MBP) but require cleavage steps for tag removal.
  - Custom plasmids with **lac/tac promoters**, **His-tag**, and **codon-optimized p53**.

### Final Answer:
The correct plasmid is the one containing:
- **Codon-optimized p53** under an **IPTG-inducible promoter** (e.g., T5, tac, or lac).
- **His-tag** for rapid IMAC purification.
- **Ampicillin resistance** and **ColE1 origin** for selection and high yield.

**Select the plasmid matching these criteria.** If the options include a pQE-like vector with these features, that’s the choice.

Wait, the strain is BL21, which does not have the T7 RNA polymerase. Therefore, if the plasmid uses a T7 promoter, it would not be expressed in BL21 unless the plasmid also encodes T7 RNA polymerase, which is not typical. Therefore, the plasmid must use a promoter that E. coli RNA polymerase can recognize, such as the lac promoter, tac promoter, or araBAD promoter.

Assuming the plasmid uses a lac or tac promoter, which is inducible by IPTG. BL21 has the lacUV5 promoter in some strains, but BL21 is DE3-negative. Therefore, the plasmid's promoter must be compatible with the host's RNA polymerase.

Additionally, the plasmid should have a multiple cloning site where the p53 gene is inserted under the control of this promoter, along with a His-tag for purification.

Moreover, codon optimization for E. coli would be essential. The human p53 gene likely has many codons that are rare in E. coli, leading to inefficient translation. Therefore, the plasmid should contain a codon-optimized version of the p53 gene.

Putting this together, the correct plasmid would be one that has:

- An origin of replication compatible with E. coli (e.g., pMB1/ColE1).

- A selectable marker (ampicillin resistance, kanamycin, etc.).

- A promoter inducible in BL21 (e.g., lac, tac, or T7 if the plasmid provides T7 RNA polymerase, which is unlikely).

Wait, but BL21 doesn't have T7 RNA polymerase. So T7 promoter-based plasmids (like pET vectors) require BL21(DE3) which carries the T7 RNA polymerase gene under lacUV5 control. Since the strain here is BL21 (not DE3), the plasmid must use a different promoter. Therefore, the plasmid must use a promoter that E. coli RNA polymerase can transcribe, such as the lac promoter. For example, pGEX vectors use the tac promoter, which is a hybrid of trp and lac promoters and is inducible by IPTG. Similarly, pMAL vectors use the tac promoter. These vectors also include tags (GST or MBP) for purification. Alternatively, pET vectors with T7 promoters require DE3 lysogens.

Given that the user wants to express p53 in BL21 (non-DE3), the plasmid must have a promoter that doesn't require T7 RNA polymerase. Therefore, the correct plasmid would be one that uses a lac or tac promoter, has a His-tag (or other affinity tag), and the p53 gene codon-optimized for E. coli.

Alternatively, if the plasmid includes the T7 RNA polymerase under an inducible promoter, but that's not standard. Typically, the T7 system relies on the host having the T7 RNA polymerase gene (as in DE3 strains). Therefore, the plasmid likely uses a different promoter.

Another consideration is whether the plasmid includes a fusion partner to enhance solubility. Human proteins in E. coli often form inclusion bodies. Fusion tags like GST, MBP, or NusA can improve solubility. However, the question mentions purifying "as quickly as possible," which might favor a His-tag for straightforward IMAC purification rather than a larger fusion tag requiring cleavage.

In summary, the correct plasmid should have:

1. Promoter compatible with E. coli BL21 (non-DE3), such as lac or tac, inducible by IPTG.

2. Codon-optimized p53 gene for E. coli.

3. Affinity tag (e.g., His-tag) for purification.

4. Appropriate antibiotic resistance.

Given that the user is given four plasmids, the correct one would be the plasmid that includes all these features. Without seeing the actual plasmid sequences, but based on standard vectors, possible candidates could be pET vectors (if BL21 is DE3, but it's not), pGEX (tac promoter, GST tag), pMAL (tac promoter, MBP tag), or a pQE vector (T5 promoter, requires lac operator, His-tag). However, pQE vectors use the T5 promoter, which is recognized by E. coli RNA polymerase and is inducible by IPTG. pQE vectors also include a His-tag. Therefore, if one of the plasmids is a pQE-based vector with codon-optimized p53, that would be suitable.

Alternatively, a pCOLD vector (cold shock promoter) might be used, but that's less common. Another possibility is a plasmid with a T7 promoter and a DE3 lysogen, but the strain here is BL21, not BL21(DE3), so that's out.

Therefore, the most likely correct answer is the plasmid that contains the p53 gene codon-optimized for E. coli, under the control of an IPTG-inducible promoter (like lac or tac), with a His-tag for purification, and an ampicillin resistance marker. Among common vectors, pQE-30 (Qiagen) is an example, which uses the T5 promoter (requires lac operator for induction), has a His6 tag, and is compatible with E. coli strains like BL21.

Alternatively, if the plasmid uses the T7 promoter but includes a T7 RNA polymerase gene under an inducible promoter, but that's not standard. Typically, T7 systems rely on the host's DE3 lysogen.

Since the user is using BL21 (not DE3), the plasmid must not require T7 RNA polymerase. Therefore, the correct plasmid is one that uses a promoter recognized by E. coli RNA polymerase, has a His-tag, and the p53 gene is codon-optimized.

Therefore, among the four plasmids, the correct one would be the one that meets these criteria. Since the question provides four options but doesn't list them, I must infer based on standard options. However, given the information, the answer is likely the plasmid that contains the p53 gene with an N-terminal His-tag, under the control of an IPTG-inducible promoter (like T5 or tac), codon-optimized for E. coli, and with an appropriate origin and antibiotic resistance.

To determine the optimal plasmid for expressing and purifying Human p53 in *E. coli* BL21, the following key considerations are critical:

### **Key Requirements for the Plasmid**

4. **Selection Marker**: 
   - Standard markers like **ampicillin resistance (ampR)** or **kanamycin resistance (kanR)** are typical but not decisive here.

### **Analysis of Likely Plasmid**
Given the constraints, the ideal plasmid would:
- Use a **tac/trc promoter** (IPTG-inducible, compatible with BL21).
- Include a **His-tag** for rapid purification.
- Contain a **codon-optimized p53 gene**.
- Feature a **high-copy origin** (e.g., pUC-derived) for high protein yield.

**Example Plasmids**:
- **pTrcHis** (Invitrogen): Trc promoter, His-tag, ampR.
- **pQE series** (Qiagen): T5 promoter, His-tag, requires lac repressor (often supplied by the plasmid or strain).

---

### **Final Answer**
**Select the plasmid with:**
- **Tac/trc promoter** (IPTG-inducible).
- **His-tag** for IMAC purification.
- **Codon-optimized p53 sequence**.

This combination ensures efficient expression in BL21 and rapid purification, aligning with the lab’s priority for speed. If the plasmid options include these features, that is the correct choice.

But the question states that there are four plasmids with different sequences. The answer lies in which plasmid includes the necessary elements. Since the user hasn't provided the actual plasmid sequences, I need to infer based on standard plasmids used for this purpose.

Common plasmids for protein expression in E. coli BL21 include pET vectors (which require T7 promoter and thus BL21(DE3)), pGEX (GST tag, tac promoter), pMAL (MBP tag), or pRSET (T7 promoter, His-tag). However, if the lab is using BL21 without DE3, then a plasmid with a tac promoter (like pGEX) would be suitable. Alternatively, if the plasmid includes the T7 RNA polymerase under an inducible promoter, but that's less common.

Wait, but the question says "4 plasmids containing 4 different sequences". The answer options (not provided) would be four different plasmid sequences.
