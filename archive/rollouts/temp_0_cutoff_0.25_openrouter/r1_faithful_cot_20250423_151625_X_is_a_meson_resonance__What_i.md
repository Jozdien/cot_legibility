To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula \( L = \gamma \beta c \tau \), where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( \beta \) is the velocity as a fraction of the speed of light, \( c \) is the speed of light, and \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

1. **Calculate the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \):**
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} = \frac{8 \, \text{GeV}}{1.2 \, \text{GeV}} \approx 6.6667
   \]

2. **Calculate the velocity factor \( \beta \):**
   \[
   \beta = \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{m_X}{E_X} \right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1.2 \, \text{GeV}}{8 \, \text{GeV}} \right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} \approx 0.9887
   \]

3. **Calculate the proper lifetime \( \tau \):**
   Using the relation \( \Gamma_X = \frac{\hbar}{\tau} \), we convert the width \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \) to lifetime:
   \[
   \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma_X} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s}}{0.32 \, \text{GeV}} \approx 2.0569 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
   \]

4. **Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \):**
   \[
   L = \gamma \beta c \tau = 6.6667 \times 0.9887 \times 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \times 2.0569 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
   \]
   Breaking down the calculation:
   \[
   6.6667 \times 0.9887 \approx 6.590
   \]
   \[
   6.590 \times 3.0 \times 10^8 \approx 1.977 \times 10^9
   \]
   \[
   1.977 \times 10^9 \times 2.0569 \times 10^{-24} \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
   \]

Thus, the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \) is \(\boxed{4.1 \times 10^{-15} \text{ m}}\).

Okay, so I need to find the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, the mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV. Hmm, let me recall what I know about particle physics and decay processes.

First, the mean decay distance, I think, is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. The formula should be something like L = γvτ, where γ is the Lorentz factor, v is the velocity, and τ is the proper lifetime. But wait, how do I get τ from the given width Γ_X?

Oh right, the uncertainty principle relates the particle's width Γ to its lifetime τ. The relation is Γ = ħ/τ. Since we're working in natural units where ħ = 1 (or more accurately, ħc ≈ 197 MeV·fm), but here the units are in GeV and MeV, so I need to be careful with the conversions.

Wait, Γ is given in MeV, which is an energy unit. The lifetime τ would be in seconds, but using Γ = ħ/τ, so τ = ħ/Γ. But since in particle physics, when using natural units (ħ = c = 1), the width Γ is related to the mean lifetime τ by Γ = ħ/τ. But to get τ in actual time units, I need to convert Γ from MeV to inverse seconds. Let me recall that 1 GeV ≈ 1.782×10^{-27} kg·m²/s², and ħ ≈ 6.582×10^{-25} GeV·s. So τ = ħ / Γ. So Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. Therefore, τ = (6.582×10^{-25} GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ≈ 2.056×10^{-24} seconds. Is that right? Let me check the calculation: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is approximately 2.056e-24. Yes, that seems correct.

But wait, the mean decay distance also depends on the Lorentz factor γ and the velocity v. So I need to calculate γ and v from the given production energy E_X and mass m_X. The production energy is 8 GeV, and the mass is 1.2 GeV. So the total energy E is related to the Lorentz factor by E = γ m c². But again, in natural units where c=1, E = γ m. So γ = E/m. Here, E_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV, so γ = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. So γ ≈ 6.6667.

Then, the velocity v can be found from γ. Since γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²), so solving for v: v = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²). Let's compute that. 1/γ² = 1/( (8/1.2)^2 ) = (1.2/8)^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Then sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887 times the speed of light, c. But since we're using natural units where c=1, the velocity is 0.9887 in units of c. But when we calculate the mean decay distance, we need to multiply by c to get it into standard units. Wait, but maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, the mean decay distance L is given by L = γ v τ c. Wait, no. Let's clarify. The proper lifetime τ is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. In the lab frame, the lifetime is dilated by γ, so the mean lifetime is γτ. Then, the distance is velocity times time, so L = v * γτ. But since τ is in seconds, and v is in meters per second, then L is in meters. But we need to make sure all the units are consistent.

Alternatively, in natural units (c=1, ħ=1), the mean decay length would be cτ multiplied by γβ, where β = v/c. But since c=1, it's just γβτ. But τ is in seconds, so cτ is in meters. So L = γβ cτ. But let's check the units. If τ is in seconds, c is in meters per second, so cτ is in meters. Then γ is dimensionless, β is dimensionless, so L is in meters. So the formula is L = γ β c τ.

But how do we compute τ? From Γ, which is given. Since Γ is the width, and Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. But ħ in units of GeV·s. Let's compute τ first.

Given Γ_X = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV. Then τ = ħ / Γ_X. The value of ħ is approximately 6.582×10^{-25} GeV·s. So τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056e-25 / 0.1 is 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) × 10^{-25} ≈ 20.56875 × 10^{-25} ≈ 2.056875 × 10^{-24} seconds. So τ ≈ 2.0569e-24 s.

Then, the mean decay distance L = γ β c τ. Let's compute each term:

γ = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667

β = v/c ≈ sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)) ≈ sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.0225) ≈ sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887

c ≈ 3.0e8 m/s

τ ≈ 2.0569e-24 s

So L ≈ 6.6667 * 0.9887 * 3.0e8 * 2.0569e-24

Let me compute step by step:

First, multiply 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.6667*(1 - 0.0113) ≈ 6.6667 - 0.0753 ≈ 6.5914. Let me check with calculator: 6.6667 * 0.9887. Let's compute 6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322, 0.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 0.6667*0.9887 ≈ 0.658. So total ≈ 5.9322 + 0.658 ≈ 6.5902. So approximately 6.590.

Then multiply by 3.0e8: 6.590 * 3.0e8 ≈ 1.977e9.

Then multiply by 2.0569e-24: 1.977e9 * 2.0569e-24 ≈ (1.977 * 2.0569) * 10^{-15} ≈ Let's compute 1.977 * 2.0569. 2 * 2.0569 = 4.1138, 0.977*2.0569 ≈ approx 2.010. So total ≈ 4.1138 + 2.010 ≈ 6.1238. So approximately 6.1238e-15 meters. Wait, that's 6.1238 femtometers. That seems really small. But is that correct?

Wait, 6.12e-15 meters is 6.12 femtometers. But particles with such short lifetimes usually decay almost immediately. But given that this is a resonance, maybe it's even shorter. Wait, but let's check the calculation again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the order of operations. Let me recalculate:

L = γ * β * c * τ

γ ≈ 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667

β ≈ sqrt(1 - (m_X / E_X)^2) = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887

c ≈ 3e8 m/s

τ = ħ / Γ_X = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.0569e-24 s

So L = 6.6667 * 0.9887 * 3e8 * 2.0569e-24

First multiply 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.590

Then 6.590 * 3e8 ≈ 1.977e9

Then 1.977e9 * 2.0569e-24 ≈ 1.977 * 2.0569 * 1e-15 ≈ 4.066e-15 meters ≈ 4.066 femtometers.

Wait, but earlier I had 6.12e-15, but now 4.066e-15. Wait, maybe I miscalculated the multiplication.

Wait, 6.6667 * 0.9887:

Let me compute 6.6667 * 0.9887:

6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322

0.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 0.6667*0.9887. Let's compute 0.6667 * 1 = 0.6667, minus 0.6667*0.0113 ≈ 0.00753. So 0.6667 - 0.00753 ≈ 0.6592. So total is 5.9322 + 0.6592 ≈ 6.5914. So 6.5914.

Then 6.5914 * 3e8 = 6.5914 * 3 * 1e8 = 19.7742 * 1e8 = 1.97742e9.

Then 1.97742e9 * 2.0569e-24 = 1.97742 * 2.0569 * 1e-15.

Compute 1.97742 * 2.0569:

Let's approximate:

2 * 2.0569 = 4.1138

Then subtract (2 - 1.97742) * 2.0569 ≈ 0.02258 * 2.0569 ≈ 0.0464.

So 4.1138 - 0.0464 ≈ 4.0674.

So total is approximately 4.0674e-15 meters, which is 4.0674 femtometers. So approximately 4.07 femtometers.

But wait, this seems extremely small. For example, the typical mean decay length for a particle like a pion is on the order of meters if it's moving relativistically, but pions have much longer lifetimes. But this is a resonance, which usually has a very short lifetime, hence a very small decay distance. But 4 femtometers is about the size of a nucleus, which is indeed very small. So maybe that's correct.

But let me check if I did the unit conversions correctly. Let's go through the steps again.

First, Γ_X is 320 MeV. Convert that to GeV: 0.32 GeV.

τ = ħ / Γ_X. The value of ħ in GeV·s is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.0569e-24 seconds. That's correct.

Then, γ = E_X / m_X = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. Correct.

β = sqrt(1 - (m_X / E_X)^2) = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) ≈ 0.9887. Correct.

Then, L = γ β c τ. So 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.590. Then 6.590 * 3e8 ≈ 1.977e9. Then 1.977e9 * 2.0569e-24 ≈ 4.067e-15 meters. So 4.067e-15 m = 4.067 femtometers. Yes, that's correct.

But just to get an idea, 1 femtometer is 1e-15 meters, which is the typical scale of a nucleus. So a decay length of ~4 femtometers is indeed very short, which makes sense for a resonance with a large width (Γ_X = 320 MeV), meaning a very short lifetime. So the particle doesn't travel far before decaying.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in some other unit, like centimeters or millimeters, but 4 femtometers is 4e-15 meters, which is 4e-13 centimeters. That's still extremely small.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check another source. The mean decay length is indeed c * γ * β * τ. Let me confirm.

Yes, the proper lifetime τ is multiplied by γ due to time dilation, and then multiplied by velocity v = β c to get the distance. So L = v * t = β c * γ τ. So yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, L = c τ γ β. So the calculation seems right.

Alternatively, maybe the production energy is not the total energy? Wait, the problem says "production energy is E_X = 8 GeV". If E_X is the kinetic energy, then the total energy would be K + m_X. But the problem states "production energy E_X =8 GeV", and mass m_X=1.2 GeV. If E_X is the total energy, then γ = E_X / m_X. But if E_X is the kinetic energy, then γ would be (K + m_X)/m_X = 1 + K/m_X. But the problem doesn't specify, but in particle physics, when someone says "production energy", it might refer to the total energy. But let's check.

If E_X is the total energy, then γ = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. If E_X is the kinetic energy, then total energy is 8 + 1.2 = 9.2 GeV, so γ = 9.2 / 1.2 ≈ 7.6667. But the problem says "production energy E_X =8 GeV". It's ambiguous, but in high-energy physics, when they talk about the energy of a particle, they usually mean the total energy. So I think the initial calculation is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the velocity is calculated differently. Let me check β. β is v/c = sqrt(1 - (m_X / E_X)^2). Since E_X is the total energy, then yes, β = sqrt(1 - (m_X / E_X)^2). So that's correct.

So, putting it all together, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.07 femtometers. But maybe the problem expects the answer in meters with scientific notation. Let me write it as approximately 4.07e-15 meters.

But let me check once more for possible miscalculations. Let's recompute τ:

Γ_X = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV

ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s

τ = ħ / Γ_X = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds. Correct.

γ = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667

β = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.0225) ≈ sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887

L = γ * β * c * τ ≈ 6.6667 * 0.9887 * 3e8 * 2.0569e-24

First, 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.590

6.590 * 3e8 ≈ 1.977e9

1.977e9 * 2.0569e-24 ≈ 4.067e-15 meters.

Yes, that's correct. So the mean decay distance is approximately 4.07e-15 meters, or 4.07 femtometers.

But just to cross-validate, let's think about the numbers. The lifetime τ is about 2e-24 seconds. At rest, the particle would travel v * τ, but since it's at rest, v=0, so it doesn't move. But when moving at γ ≈ 6.6667, the lifetime is dilated by γ, so the lab frame lifetime is γτ ≈ 6.6667 * 2.0569e-24 ≈ 1.371e-23 seconds. Then, the distance is v * t = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 1.371e-23 s ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 * 1.371e-23 ≈ 0.9887 * 4.113e-15 ≈ 4.07e-15 meters. Same result. So that's correct.

Therefore, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.07 femtometers. Since the problem gives Γ_X as 320 MeV, which is quite large, leading to a very short lifetime, hence a very small decay length. That makes sense for a resonance, which typically has a very short lifetime.

So, the final answer should be approximately 4.1e-15 meters, or 4.1 femtometers. Depending on the precision required, maybe two significant figures. The given Γ_X is 320 MeV, which is two significant figures, E_X is 8 GeV (one significant figure?), but maybe they expect more precise. Wait, 8 GeV is one significant figure, but maybe written as 8.0 GeV for two. But the mass is 1.2 GeV (two significant figures), and Γ_X is 320 MeV (two or three? 3.2e2 MeV, so two). So probably the answer should have two significant figures. So 4.1e-15 meters, or 4.1 femtometers. But let me check the exact calculation again.

Exact calculation:

τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 6.582 / 0.32 * 1e-25 = 20.56875 * 1e-25 = 2.056875e-24 s.

γ = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666...

β = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9886854153.

Then L = 6.666666... * 0.9886854153 * 3e8 * 2.056875e-24.

First multiply 6.666666... * 0.9886854153:

6 * 0.9886854153 = 5.932112492

0.666666... * 0.9886854153 ≈ 0.6666666667 * 0.9886854153 ≈ 0.658790.

Total ≈ 5.932112492 + 0.658790 ≈ 6.590902492.

Then multiply by 3e8: 6.590902492 * 3e8 ≈ 19.77270748e8 ≈ 1.977270748e9.

Then multiply by 2.056875e-24: 1.977270748e9 * 2.056875e-24 ≈

First multiply 1.977270748 * 2.056875 ≈

Let's compute 2 * 2.056875 = 4.11375

Then subtract (2 - 1.977270748) * 2.056875 ≈ 0.022729252 * 2.056875 ≈ 0.0467.

So 4.11375 - 0.0467 ≈ 4.06705.

So total ≈ 4.06705e-15 meters. So approximately 4.07e-15 m.

So with three significant figures, 4.07e-15 m. But given the inputs, maybe two significant figures. The production energy is 8 GeV (1 sig fig), mass 1.2 GeV (2 sig figs), width 320 MeV (2 sig figs). The least number of sig figs is 1 (from 8 GeV), but maybe in the context of particle physics, they might consider 8 GeV as having more precision. But if we take 8 GeV as 1 sig fig, then the answer should be 4e-15 m. But the problem might expect two sig figs. Let's see.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in units of meters with scientific notation. So 4.07e-15 m. But let me check if there's a standard way to present this.

Alternatively, maybe convert femtometers to some other unit? 1 femtometer is 1e-15 meters, so 4.07e-15 m is 4.07 fm. So writing 4.1 fm or 4.07 fm.

But the problem says "mean decay distance", and given the numbers, I think 4.1e-15 meters or 4.1 femtometers is appropriate with two significant figures. Since Γ_X is 320 MeV (two sig figs), m_X is 1.2 GeV (two sig figs), E_X is 8 GeV (one sig fig). The least is one, but maybe the 8 GeV is an exact value? If not, then one sig fig. But 8 GeV could be considered as 8.0, but it's written as 8, so maybe one. If so, then the answer should be 4e-15 m. But given that the intermediate steps have more precision, maybe the answer is expected to be around 4.1e-15 m. Let me check with the exact calculation.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the use of natural units where c=1 and then convert properly. Wait, in natural units, c=1, ħ=1. So in natural units, the decay length would be L = γ β τ. But τ in natural units is 1/Γ_X (since Γ_X = ħ/τ, and ħ=1). So τ = 1/Γ_X. But Γ_X is given in MeV, so we need to convert to GeV. Γ_X = 0.32 GeV. So τ = 1 / 0.32 GeV^{-1}. Then, to convert to meters, we need to use the conversion factor where 1 GeV^{-1} = ħc / (1 GeV) ≈ (197.33 MeV·fm) / (1000 MeV) ) = 0.19733 fm ≈ 0.19733e-15 m. So 1 GeV^{-1} ≈ 0.19733e-15 m. Therefore, τ in meters is (1 / 0.32 GeV) * 0.19733e-15 m/GeV^{-1} ≈ (3.125) * 0.19733e-15 ≈ 0.6166e-15 m. Then, L = γ β τ ≈ 6.6667 * 0.9887 * 0.6166e-15 ≈ 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.590 * 0.6166e-15 ≈ 4.066e-15 m. Same result. So this confirms the previous calculation.

Therefore, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.07e-15 meters, or 4.07 femtometers. Depending on the significant figures, it's about 4.1e-15 m.

But let me check if there's a different approach. For example, using the formula for the decay length L = (E_X * c * ħ) / (m_X * Γ_X). Wait, let's see:

From L = γ β c τ, and τ = ħ / Γ_X, so L = γ β c (ħ / Γ_X). But γ = E_X / m_X, and β = sqrt(1 - (m_X / E_X)^2). So substituting:

L = (E_X / m_X) * sqrt(1 - (m_X / E_X)^2) * c * ħ / Γ_X

But this seems more complicated. Let's compute it:

E_X =8 GeV, m_X=1.2 GeV, Γ_X=0.32 GeV, ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm = 0.19733 GeV·fm.

So L = (8 / 1.2) * sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) * 0.19733 GeV·fm / 0.32 GeV

Simplify:

(8 / 1.2) ≈ 6.6667

sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2) ≈ 0.9887

0.19733 / 0.32 ≈ 0.6166

So L ≈ 6.6667 * 0.9887 * 0.6166 fm ≈ 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.590 * 0.6166 ≈ 4.066 fm ≈ 4.066e-15 m. Same result. So this method also gives the same answer. Therefore, the calculation is correct.

Therefore, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.07 femtometers, or 4.07e-15 meters. So the answer is \boxed{4.1 \times 10^{-15} \text{ m}}.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to find the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, the mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV. Hmm, let me recall what I know about particle physics and decay processes.

First, the mean decay distance, I think, is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. The formula should be something like L = γvτ, where γ is the Lorentz factor, v is the velocity, and τ is the proper lifetime. But wait, how do I get τ from the given width Γ_X?

Oh right, the uncertainty principle relates the particle's width Γ to its lifetime τ. The relation is Γ = ħ/τ. Since we're working in natural units where ħ = 1 (or more accurately, ħc ≈ 197 MeV·fm), but here the units are in GeV and MeV, so I need to be careful with the conversions.

Wait, Γ is given in MeV, which is an energy unit. The lifetime τ would be in seconds, but using Γ = ħ/τ, so τ = ħ/Γ. But since in particle physics, when using natural units (ħ = c = 1), the width Γ is related to the mean lifetime τ by Γ = ħ/τ. But to get τ in actual time units, I need to convert Γ from MeV to inverse seconds. Let me recall that 1 GeV ≈ 1.782×10^{-27} kg·m²/s², and ħ ≈ 6.582×10^{-25} GeV·s. So τ = ħ / Γ. So Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. Therefore, τ = (6.582×10^{-25} GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ≈ 2.056×10^{-24} seconds. Is that right? Let me check the calculation: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is approximately 2.056e-24. Yes, that seems correct.

But wait, the mean decay distance also depends on the Lorentz factor γ and the velocity v. So I need to calculate γ and v from the given production energy E_X and mass m_X. The production energy is 8 GeV, and the mass is 1.2 GeV. So the total energy E is related to the Lorentz factor by E = γ m c². But again, in natural units where c=1, E = γ m. So γ = E/m. Here, E_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV, so γ = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. So γ ≈ 6.6667.

Then, the velocity v can be found from γ. Since γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²), so solving for v: v = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²). Let's compute that. 1/γ² = 1/( (8/1.2)^2 ) = (1.2/8)^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Then sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887 times the speed of light, c. But since we're using natural units where c=1, the velocity is 0.9887 in units of c. But when we calculate the mean decay distance, we need to multiply by c to get it into standard units. Wait, but maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, the mean decay distance L is given by L = γ v τ c. Wait, no. Let's clarify. The proper lifetime τ is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. In the lab frame, the lifetime is dilated by γ, so the mean lifetime is γτ. Then, the distance is velocity times time, so L = v * γτ. But since τ is in seconds, and v is in meters per second, then L is in meters. But we need to make sure all the units are consistent.

Alternatively, in natural units (c=1, ħ=1), the mean decay length would be cτ multiplied by γβ, where β = v/c. But since c=1, it's just γβτ. But τ is in seconds, so cτ is in meters. So L = γβ cτ. But let's check the units. If τ is in seconds, c is in meters per second, so cτ is in meters. Then γ is dimensionless, β is dimensionless, so L is in meters. So the formula is L = γ β c τ.

But how do we compute τ? From Γ, which is given. Since Γ is the width, and Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. But ħ in units of GeV·s. Let's compute τ first.

Given Γ_X = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV. Then τ = ħ / Γ_X. The value of ħ is approximately 6.582×10^{-25} GeV·s. So τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056e-25 / 0.1 is 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) × 10^{-25} ≈ 20.56875 × 10^{-25} ≈ 2.056875 × 10^{-24} seconds. So τ ≈ 2.0569e-24 s.

Then, the mean decay distance L = γ β c τ. Let's compute each term:

γ = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667

β = v/c ≈ sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)) ≈ sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.0225) ≈ sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887

c ≈ 3.0e8 m/s

I need to determine the mean decay distance of meson resonance X with production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. This calculation requires applying concepts from particle physics and relativity.

The mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and velocity through the formula L = γvτ, where γ is the Lorentz factor, v is velocity, and τ is proper lifetime. To find τ, I need to use the uncertainty principle relationship between width and lifetime: Γ = ħ/τ, which means τ = ħ/Γ.

Since Γ_X = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV, and ħ ≈ 6.582×10^(-25) GeV·s, I can calculate τ = ħ/Γ_X = (6.582×10^(-25) GeV·s)/(0.32 GeV) ≈ 2.056×10^(-24) seconds.

Next, I need to calculate the Lorentz factor γ using the production energy and mass. In natural units (c=1), E = γm, so γ = E/m = 8 GeV/1.2 GeV ≈ 6.6667.

From γ, I can determine the velocity parameter β = v/c using the relationship β = sqrt(1-1/γ²). Computing this: 1/γ² = 1/((8/1.2)²) = (1.2/8)² = (0.15)² = 0.0225. Therefore, β = sqrt(1-0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

The mean decay distance formula is L = γβcτ, where c is the speed of light (approximately 3.0×10^8 m/s). So I need to multiply γ = 6.6667, β = 0.9887, c = 3.0×10^8 m/s, and τ = 2.056×10^(-24) seconds to find the mean decay distance.

Alright, I need to calculate the mean decay distance for a meson resonance X. The parameters I'm working with are: production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. Let me think through my understanding of particle physics and decay processes.

The mean decay distance is connected to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. The formula should look like L = γvτ, where γ is the Lorentz factor, v is velocity, and τ is the proper lifetime. But how do I derive τ from the width Γ_X?

Ah, the uncertainty principle connects the particle's width Γ to its lifetime τ through Γ = ħ/τ. With natural units where ħ = 1 (though more precisely, ħc ≈ 197 MeV·fm), I must be careful with unit conversions since measurements are in GeV and MeV.

Given Γ is in energy units (MeV), τ should be in seconds using Γ = ħ/τ. Converting the width Γ into inverse seconds using τ = ħ/Γ becomes necessary. Recall that 1 GeV ≈ 1.782×10^{-27} kg·m²/s², and ħ ≈ 6.582×10^{-25} GeV·s. So, τ = ħ / Γ. Here Γ is 320 MeV, equating to 0.32 GeV. Therefore, τ = (6.582×10^{-25} GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ≈ 2.056×10^{-24} seconds. Let's verify: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is about 2.056e-24. Yes, it looks correct.

The mean decay distance, however, also demands γ and v. With the production energy E_X as 8 GeV and mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, we relate the total energy E to γ by E = γ m c². In natural units where c=1, it's E = γ m. Thus, γ = E/m becomes 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

Next, compute velocity v using γ. Since γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²), solve for v: v = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²). Calculating this yields 1/γ² = 1/( (8/1.2)^2 ) or (1.2/8)^2, evaluating to (0.15)² = 0.0225. Therefore, 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775, leading to sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. Hence v ≈ 0.9887 times the speed of light, c. Since natural units have c=1, velocity is 0.9887 in units of c.

To find the mean decay distance, we use L = γ v τ, knowing τ is in seconds and v in meters per second, so L will be in meters. In these units, mean decay length simplifies to γβτ, where β = v/c. When c=1, it's simply γβτ, but τ is in seconds. Therefore, the formulated L is γ β c τ, ensuring consistency across units.

For τ, given Γ_X = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV, τ = ħ / Γ_X. With ħ approximately 6.582×10^{-25} GeV·s, τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056e-25 / 0.1 equates to 6.582e-25 / 0.32, which equals (6.582 / 0.32) × 10^{-25} ≈ 20.56875 × 10^{-25} ≈ 2.056875 × 10^{-24} seconds, thus τ ≈ 2.0569e-24 s.

Finally, we have L = γ β c τ. Calculating each term:

γ = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667

β = v/c ≈ sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)) ≈ sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)²) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.0225) ≈ sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887

c ≈ 3.0e8 m/s

So approximately 6.5913.\n\nThen, multiply by 3.0e8 m/s * 2.0569e-24 s: 3.0e8 * 2.0569e-24 = 6.1707e-16 m. Then multiply by 6.5913: 6.5913 * 6.1707e-16 ≈ let\'s compute 6 * 6.1707e-16 = 3.7024e-15, 0.5913 * 6.1707e-16 ≈ 3.648e-16. So total ≈ 3.7024e-15 + 3.648e-16 ≈ 4.0672e-15 meters. Wait, that\'s 4.0672e-15 meters? That seems extremely small. But wait, 1 femtometer is 1e-15 meters, so this is about 4 femtometers. But that seems way too short for a decay length. Wait, but mesons typically have very short lifetimes. For example, charged pions have lifetimes around 26 nanoseconds, which gives a decay length of several meters if they\'re moving relativistically. But this is a resonance, so maybe it\'s even shorter-lived?\n\nWait, but let\'s check the numbers again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nFirst, let\'s recheck τ. Γ_X is 320 MeV. So τ = ħ / Γ_X. ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Γ_X is 0.32 GeV. So τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.0569e-24 seconds. That\'s correct.\n\nThen, γ is E/m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV ≈ 6.6667. Correct.\n\nβ = sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2) = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. Correct.\n\nSo L = γ β c τ = 6.6667 * 0.9887 * 3e8 * 2.0569e-24\n\nCompute step by step:\n\nFirst, 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.5913 (as before)\n\nThen, 3e8 m/s * 2.0569e-24 s ≈ 6.1707e-16 m\n\nMultiply by 6.5913: 6.5913 * 6.1707e-16 ≈ 4.067e-15 m ≈ 4.067 femtometers.\n\nHmm, 4 femtometers is about the size of a nucleus. That seems too short for a decay length. But maybe for a resonance, which has an extremely short lifetime, the decay length is indeed immeasurably small. Because resonances typically decay via the strong interaction, which has lifetimes on the order of 10^{-24} seconds, leading to decay lengths of femtometers. Whereas weak decays have longer lifetimes, like the pion\'s 26 nanoseconds, leading to meters of decay length.\n\nSo perhaps 4 femtometers is correct. But let me check with another approach. Maybe using the formula L = c * γ * β * τ.\n\nBut let\'s compute it again:\n\nc = 3e8 m/s\n\nγ = 6.6667\n\nβ = 0.9887\n\nτ = 2.0569e-24 s\n\nSo L = 3e8 * 6.6667 * 0.9887 * 2.0569e-24\n\nFirst, multiply 3e8 * 6.6667 ≈ 2e9 (exactly 3*6.6667=20.0001, so 20.0001e8 = 2.00001e9)\n\nThen multiply by 0.9887: 2.00001e9 * 0.9887 ≈ 1.9774e9\n\nThen multiply by 2.0569e-24: 1.9774e9 * 2.0569e-24 ≈ (1.9774 * 2.0569) * 1e-15 ≈ 4.067 * 1e-15 ≈ 4.067e-15 meters. Same result.\n\nSo 4.067 femtometers. That\'s 4.067e-15 meters. So, yes, that seems correct. But is there a mistake in the reasoning?\n\nWait, but the problem says "mean decay distance". For a resonance, which is a very short-lived particle, the width is related to the lifetime. But perhaps the production energy is the key here. Wait, the production energy is given as 8 GeV. But when we compute γ, we used E = 8 GeV and m = 1.2 GeV. But is that correct?\n\nWait, in particle physics, the total energy E of a particle is related to its momentum p and mass m by E² = p²c² + m²c⁴. But in natural units (c=1), E² = p² + m². So if the particle is produced with a certain energy, which is much larger than its mass, then it\'s moving relativistically. So in this case, E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV, so yes, E >> m, so γ ≈ E/m = 8/1.2 ≈ 6.6667. So that\'s correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the production energy is the kinetic energy, then we need to adjust. But the problem states "production energy is E_X = 8 GeV". Typically, in particle physics, when they say production energy, they mean the total energy, not the kinetic energy. So I think using E = γ m is correct here.\n\nTherefore, the calculation seems correct, leading to a mean decay distance of approximately 4.07 femtometers. But let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, the mean decay length can be calculated using:\n\nL = (c * ħ / (m * Γ)) * (E / m) * sqrt(1 - (m² / E²))\n\nWait, let\'s see. Let\'s derive the formula again.\n\nThe proper lifetime τ = ħ / Γ. Then, the lab frame lifetime is γ τ. The velocity v = β c. So the decay length is L = v γ τ = β γ c τ = β γ c (ħ / Γ). Then, substituting γ = E / (m c²) (but in natural units, γ = E / m). So in natural units, L = β γ (c τ) = β γ (c ħ / Γ). But with c=1 and ħ=1 in natural units, but we need to convert back to SI units.\n\nWait, perhaps another way. Let\'s use L = β γ c τ. τ is ħ / Γ. So L = β γ c (ħ / Γ). Let\'s plug in the numbers.\n\nβ ≈ 0.9887\n\nγ ≈ 6.6667\n\nc ≈ 3e8 m/s\n\nħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s\n\nΓ = 0.32 GeV\n\nSo L = 0.9887 * 6.6667 * 3e8 * 6.582e-25 / 0.32\n\nCompute step by step:\n\nFirst, multiply 0.9887 * 6.6667 ≈ 6.5913 (as before)\n\nThen, 6.5913 * 3e8 ≈ 1.9774e9\n\nThen, 1.9774e9 * 6.582e-25 ≈ 1.9774 * 6.582 * 1e-16 ≈ 13.02 * 1e-16 ≈ 1.302e-15\n\nThen divide by 0.32: 1.302e-15 / 0.32 ≈ 4.068e-15 meters. Same result. So that\'s consistent.\n\nTherefore, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.07e-15 meters, or 4.07 femtometers. That seems extremely small, but given that Γ_X is 320 MeV, which is a very large width (corresponding to a very short lifetime), this makes sense. For example, the Rho meson has a width around 150 MeV and a lifetime of about 4.5e-24 seconds, leading to a similar decay length.\n\nBut just to confirm, let\'s compare with a known particle. Take the Rho meson, mass ~770 MeV, width ~150 MeV. Let\'s compute its mean decay distance if produced at the same energy, say 8 GeV. Wait, but production energy would affect γ. Let\'s compute for the Rho meson with E=8 GeV, m=0.77 GeV, Γ=0.15 GeV.\n\nγ = 8 / 0.77 ≈ 10.3896\n\nβ = sqrt(1 - (0.77/8)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.0093) ≈ 0.9953\n\nτ = ħ / Γ = 6.582e-25 / 0.15 ≈ 4.388e-24 s\n\nL = 10.3896 * 0.9953 * 3e8 * 4.388e-24 ≈ 10.3896 * 0.9953 ≈ 10.34, then 10.34 * 3e8 = 3.102e9, then 3.102e9 * 4.388e-24 ≈ 1.36e-14 meters, which is 13.6 femtometers. So the Rho meson at 8 GeV would have a decay length of ~14 femtometers. Since our X meson has a larger width (320 MeV vs 150 MeV), the lifetime is shorter, so the decay length is shorter (4 femtometers vs 14 femtometers). That seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the calculation seems correct. So the mean decay distance is approximately 4.07 femtometers. But the problem might expect the answer in some other unit, like meters, centimeters, or maybe using a different convention. Let me check the calculation once more.\n\nWait, 4.07e-15 meters is 4.07 femtometers. In particle physics, decay lengths are sometimes expressed in centimeters, especially for weak decays. For example, the charged pion has a decay length on the order of meters. But for strong decays (resonances), the decay length is way smaller than a femtometer? Wait, 1 femtometer is 1e-15 meters, which is the typical size of a nucleus. So a decay length of 4 femtometers would mean the particle decays almost immediately after production, within the nucleus. That makes sense for a resonance, which doesn\'t travel a measurable distance before decaying. Hence, such resonances are observed as peaks in invariant mass plots rather than as tracks in detectors.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 4.1 femtometers. But let me check if there\'s a possible miscalculation. Wait, 4.07e-15 meters is 4.07 femtometers. Yes. So converting to more standard units in particle physics, sometimes they use "natural units" but here the answer is expected in meters or centimeters. But 4.07e-15 meters is 4.07e-13 centimeters, which is 0.000407 femtometers? Wait, no. Wait, 1 meter is 100 centimeters, so 1 femtometer is 1e-15 meters = 1e-13 centimeters. So 4.07e-15 meters = 4.07e-13 centimeters. So 0.407 femtometers? Wait, no. Wait, 1 femtometer is 1e-15 meters, so 4.07e-15 meters is 4.07 femtometers. In centimeters, that\'s 4.07e-13 cm. But maybe the problem expects the answer in meters. However, 4.07e-15 meters is correct. Alternatively, maybe express it in terms of ħc.\n\nWait, another approach. In natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, the decay length L can be written as L = (E / m) * (1 / Γ) * sqrt(1 - (m² / E²)). Because τ = 1/Γ (in natural units), and γ = E/m, β = sqrt(1 - m²/E²). So L = γ β / Γ. But in natural units, length is in inverse energy. To convert to meters, we need to multiply by ħ c / (energy unit). Let\'s see.\n\nSo in natural units (GeV), L_natural = γ β / Γ. Then, converting to meters: L = L_natural * (ħ c / GeV). So let\'s compute:\n\nγ = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667\n\nβ = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) ≈ 0.9887\n\nΓ = 0.32 GeV\n\nSo L_natural = 6.6667 * 0.9887 / 0.32 ≈ 6.5913 / 0.32 ≈ 20.598 GeV^{-1}\n\nThen, convert GeV^{-1} to meters: 1 GeV^{-1} = (ħ c / GeV) ≈ (6.582e-25 GeV·s * 3e8 m/s) / 1 GeV ≈ 1.9746e-16 m. Therefore, L = 20.598 * 1.9746e-16 m ≈ 4.07e-15 m. Same result. So that\'s consistent.\n\nTherefore, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.07e-15 meters, or 4.07 femtometers. So the answer is 4.1 femtometers, which can be written as 4.1 × 10^{-15} meters.\n\nBut let me check if the question expects the answer in centimeters or another unit. The problem didn\'t specify, but in particle physics, sometimes centimeters are used for decay lengths. 4.07e-15 meters is 4.07e-13 centimeters. But that\'s still 0.000407 femtometers, which is the same as 4.07 femtometers. Wait, no. Wait, 1 centimeter is 1e-2 meters, so 1e-15 meters is 1e-13 centimeters. Therefore, 4.07e-15 meters = 4.07e-13 centimeters. But 4.07e-13 cm is 4.07e-15 meters. Either way, it\'s 4.07 femtometers. So depending on the convention, but femtometers (fm) are 1e-15 meters. So 4.07 fm is appropriate.\n\nBut let me check if I made a mistake in the velocity calculation. Let\'s recalculate β:\n\nβ = sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2) = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775). Let\'s compute sqrt(0.9775). Let\'s see, sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. Let me compute it more accurately. 0.9887 squared is (1 - 0.0113)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.0226 + 0.000127 ≈ 0.9775. So yes, 0.9887 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the exact value:\n\n(1.2/8)^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225\n\n1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775\n\nsqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. Correct.\n\nSo all steps are correct. Therefore, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.07 femtometers. Since the problem gives Γ_X as 320 MeV, which is quite large, leading to a very short lifetime, the decay length is indeed minuscule.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is approximately 4.1 × 10^{-15} meters, or 4.1 femtometers. So I should present the answer in meters, using scientific notation.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe mean decay distance is \\boxed{4.1 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ m}}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745446879, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4208, prompt_tokens=1360, total_tokens=5568, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To find the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula \( L = \gamma \beta c \tau \), where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( \beta \) is the velocity as a fraction of the speed of light \( c \), and \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

   \]

3. **Calculate the proper lifetime \( \tau \):**
   \[
   \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma_X} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s}}{0.32 \, \text{GeV}} \approx 2.0569 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}

   \]
   Breaking down the calculation:
   \[
   6.6667 \times 0.9887 \approx 6.5913
   \]
   \[
   3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \times 2.0569 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \approx 6.1707 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}

   \[
   L \approx 6.5913 \times 6.1707 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m} \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}

τ ≈ 2.0569e-24 s

So L ≈ 6.6667 * 0.9887 * 3.0e8 m/s * 2.0569e-24 s

First, multiply 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ let's compute 6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322, 0.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 0.6591, so total ≈ 5.9322 + 0.6591 ≈ 6.5913. So approximately 6.5913.

Then, multiply by 3.0e8 m/s * 2.0569e-24 s: 3.0e8 * 2.0569e-24 = 6.1707e-16 m. Then multiply by 6.5913: 6.5913 * 6.1707e-16 ≈ let's compute 6 * 6.1707e-16 = 3.7024e-15, 0.5913 * 6.1707e-16 ≈ 3.648e-16. So total ≈ 3.7024e-15 + 3.648e-16 ≈ 4.0672e-15 meters. Wait, that's 4.0672e-15 meters? That seems extremely small. But wait, 1 femtometer is 1e-15 meters, so this is about 4 femtometers. But that seems way too short for a decay length. Wait, but mesons typically have very short lifetimes. For example, charged pions have lifetimes around 26 nanoseconds, which gives a decay length of several meters if they're moving relativistically. But this is a resonance, so maybe it's even shorter-lived?

Wait, but let's check the numbers again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

First, let's recheck τ. Γ_X is 320 MeV. So τ = ħ / Γ_X. ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Γ_X is 0.32 GeV. So τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.0569e-24 seconds. That's correct.

Then, γ is E/m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV ≈ 6.6667. Correct.

β = sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2) = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. Correct.

So L = γ β c τ = 6.6667 * 0.9887 * 3e8 * 2.0569e-24

Compute step by step:

First, 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.5913 (as before)

Then, 3e8 m/s * 2.0569e-24 s ≈ 6.1707e-16 m

Multiply by 6.5913: 6.5913 * 6.1707e-16 ≈ 4.067e-15 m ≈ 4.067 femtometers.

Hmm, 4 femtometers is about the size of a nucleus. That seems too short for a decay length. But maybe for a resonance, which has an extremely short lifetime, the decay length is indeed immeasurably small. Because resonances typically decay via the strong interaction, which has lifetimes on the order of 10^{-24} seconds, leading to decay lengths of femtometers. Whereas weak decays have longer lifetimes, like the pion's 26 nanoseconds, leading to meters of decay length.

So perhaps 4 femtometers is correct. But let me check with another approach. Maybe using the formula L = c * γ * β * τ.

But let's compute it again:

c = 3e8 m/s

γ = 6.6667

β = 0.9887

τ = 2.0569e-24 s

So L = 3e8 * 6.6667 * 0.9887 * 2.0569e-24

First, multiply 3e8 * 6.6667 ≈ 2e9 (exactly 3*6.6667=20.0001, so 20.0001e8 = 2.00001e9)

Then multiply by 0.9887: 2.00001e9 * 0.9887 ≈ 1.9774e9

Then multiply by 2.0569e-24: 1.9774e9 * 2.0569e-24 ≈ (1.9774 * 2.0569) * 1e-15 ≈ 4.067 * 1e-15 ≈ 4.067e-15 meters. Same result.

So 4.067 femtometers. That's 4.067e-15 meters. So, yes, that seems correct. But is there a mistake in the reasoning?

Wait, but the problem says "mean decay distance". For a resonance, which is a very short-lived particle, the width is related to the lifetime. But perhaps the production energy is the key here. Wait, the production energy is given as 8 GeV. But when we compute γ, we used E = 8 GeV and m = 1.2 GeV. But is that correct?

Wait, in particle physics, the total energy E of a particle is related to its momentum p and mass m by E² = p²c² + m²c⁴. But in natural units (c=1), E² = p² + m². So if the particle is produced with a certain energy, which is much larger than its mass, then it's moving relativistically. So in this case, E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV, so yes, E >> m, so γ ≈ E/m = 8/1.2 ≈ 6.6667. So that's correct.

Alternatively, if the production energy is the kinetic energy, then we need to adjust. But the problem states "production energy is E_X = 8 GeV". Typically, in particle physics, when they say production energy, they mean the total energy, not the kinetic energy. So I think using E = γ m is correct here.

Therefore, the calculation seems correct, leading to a mean decay distance of approximately 4.07 femtometers. But let me check with another approach.

Alternatively, the mean decay length can be calculated using:

L = (c * ħ / (m * Γ)) * (E / m) * sqrt(1 - (m² / E²))

Wait, let's see. Let's derive the formula again.

The proper lifetime τ = ħ / Γ. Then, the lab frame lifetime is γ τ. The velocity v = β c. So the decay length is L = v γ τ = β γ c τ = β γ c (ħ / Γ). Then, substituting γ = E / (m c²) (but in natural units, γ = E / m). So in natural units, L = β γ (c τ) = β γ (c ħ / Γ). But with c=1 and ħ=1 in natural units, but we need to convert back to SI units.

Wait, perhaps another way. Let's use L = β γ c τ. τ is ħ / Γ. So L = β γ c (ħ / Γ). Let's plug in the numbers.

β ≈ 0.9887

γ ≈ 6.6667

c ≈ 3e8 m/s

ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s

Γ = 0.32 GeV

So L = 0.9887 * 6.6667 * 3e8 * 6.582e-25 / 0.32

Compute step by step:

First, multiply 0.9887 * 6.6667 ≈ 6.5913 (as before)

Then, 6.5913 * 3e8 ≈ 1.9774e9

Then, 1.9774e9 * 6.582e-25 ≈ 1.9774 * 6.582 * 1e-16 ≈ 13.02 * 1e-16 ≈ 1.302e-15

Then divide by 0.32: 1.302e-15 / 0.32 ≈ 4.068e-15 meters. Same result. So that's consistent.

Therefore, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.07e-15 meters, or 4.07 femtometers. That seems extremely small, but given that Γ_X is 320 MeV, which is a very large width (corresponding to a very short lifetime), this makes sense. For example, the Rho meson has a width around 150 MeV and a lifetime of about 4.5e-24 seconds, leading to a similar decay length.

But just to confirm, let's compare with a known particle. Take the Rho meson, mass ~770 MeV, width ~150 MeV. Let's compute its mean decay distance if produced at the same energy, say 8 GeV. Wait, but production energy would affect γ. Let's compute for the Rho meson with E=8 GeV, m=0.77 GeV, Γ=0.15 GeV.

γ = 8 / 0.77 ≈ 10.3896

β = sqrt(1 - (0.77/8)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.0093) ≈ 0.9953

τ = ħ / Γ = 6.582e-25 / 0.15 ≈ 4.388e-24 s

L = 10.3896 * 0.9953 * 3e8 * 4.388e-24 ≈ 10.3896 * 0.9953 ≈ 10.34, then 10.34 * 3e8 = 3.102e9, then 3.102e9 * 4.388e-24 ≈ 1.36e-14 meters, which is 13.6 femtometers. So the Rho meson at 8 GeV would have a decay length of ~14 femtometers. Since our X meson has a larger width (320 MeV vs 150 MeV), the lifetime is shorter, so the decay length is shorter (4 femtometers vs 14 femtometers). That seems consistent.

Therefore, the calculation seems correct. So the mean decay distance is approximately 4.07 femtometers. But the problem might expect the answer in some other unit, like meters, centimeters, or maybe using a different convention. Let me check the calculation once more.

Wait, 4.07e-15 meters is 4.07 femtometers. In particle physics, decay lengths are sometimes expressed in centimeters, especially for weak decays. For example, the charged pion has a decay length on the order of meters. But for strong decays (resonances), the decay length is way smaller than a femtometer? Wait, 1 femtometer is 1e-15 meters, which is the typical size of a nucleus. So a decay length of 4 femtometers would mean the particle decays almost immediately after production, within the nucleus. That makes sense for a resonance, which doesn't travel a measurable distance before decaying. Hence, such resonances are observed as peaks in invariant mass plots rather than as tracks in detectors.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 4.1 femtometers. But let me check if there's a possible miscalculation. Wait, 4.07e-15 meters is 4.07 femtometers. Yes. So converting to more standard units in particle physics, sometimes they use "natural units" but here the answer is expected in meters or centimeters. But 4.07e-15 meters is 4.07e-13 centimeters, which is 0.000407 femtometers? Wait, no. Wait, 1 meter is 100 centimeters, so 1 femtometer is 1e-15 meters = 1e-13 centimeters. So 4.07e-15 meters = 4.07e-13 centimeters. So 0.407 femtometers? Wait, no. Wait, 1 femtometer is 1e-15 meters, so 4.07e-15 meters is 4.07 femtometers. In centimeters, that's 4.07e-13 cm. But maybe the problem expects the answer in meters. However, 4.07e-15 meters is correct. Alternatively, maybe express it in terms of ħc.

Wait, another approach. In natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, the decay length L can be written as L = (E / m) * (1 / Γ) * sqrt(1 - (m² / E²)). Because τ = 1/Γ (in natural units), and γ = E/m, β = sqrt(1 - m²/E²). So L = γ β / Γ. But in natural units, length is in inverse energy. To convert to meters, we need to multiply by ħ c / (energy unit). Let's see.

So in natural units (GeV), L_natural = γ β / Γ. Then, converting to meters: L = L_natural * (ħ c / GeV). So let's compute:

γ = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667

β = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) ≈ 0.9887

Γ = 0.32 GeV

So L_natural = 6.6667 * 0.9887 / 0.32 ≈ 6.5913 / 0.32 ≈ 20.598 GeV^{-1}

Then, convert GeV^{-1} to meters: 1 GeV^{-1} = (ħ c / GeV) ≈ (6.582e-25 GeV·s * 3e8 m/s) / 1 GeV ≈ 1.9746e-16 m. Therefore, L = 20.598 * 1.9746e-16 m ≈ 4.07e-15 m. Same result. So that's consistent.

Therefore, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.07e-15 meters, or 4.07 femtometers. So the answer is 4.1 femtometers, which can be written as 4.1 × 10^{-15} meters.

But let me check if the question expects the answer in centimeters or another unit. The problem didn't specify, but in particle physics, sometimes centimeters are used for decay lengths. 4.07e-15 meters is 4.07e-13 centimeters. But that's still 0.000407 femtometers, which is the same as 4.07 femtometers. Wait, no. Wait, 1 centimeter is 1e-2 meters, so 1e-15 meters is 1e-13 centimeters. Therefore, 4.07e-15 meters = 4.07e-13 centimeters. But 4.07e-13 cm is 4.07e-15 meters. Either way, it's 4.07 femtometers. So depending on the convention, but femtometers (fm) are 1e-15 meters. So 4.07 fm is appropriate.

But let me check if I made a mistake in the velocity calculation. Let's recalculate β:

β = sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2) = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775). Let's compute sqrt(0.9775). Let's see, sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. Let me compute it more accurately. 0.9887 squared is (1 - 0.0113)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.0226 + 0.000127 ≈ 0.9775. So yes, 0.9887 is correct.

Alternatively, using the exact value:

(1.2/8)^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225

1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775

sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. Correct.

So all steps are correct. Therefore, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.07 femtometers. Since the problem gives Γ_X as 320 MeV, which is quite large, leading to a very short lifetime, the decay length is indeed minuscule.

Therefore, the final answer is approximately 4.1 × 10^{-15} meters, or 4.1 femtometers. So I should present the answer in meters, using scientific notation.

**Final Answer**
The mean decay distance is \boxed{4.1 \times 10^{-15} \text{ m}}.

Let me check β again. β = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)) when E is the total energy. Wait, actually, the total energy is E = γm, so γ = E/m. Then, β = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)) = sqrt(1 - (1.2^2)/(8^2)) = sqrt(1 - 1.44/64) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. That's correct.\n\nSo the velocity is about 0.9887c.

That's indeed very small, but considering the particle's short lifetime due to the large width (Γ = 320 MeV), the lifetime τ is extremely short, leading to a tiny decay length. However, this seems inconsistent with typical particle decay lengths, which are often on the order of millimeters or centimeters for weakly decaying particles. But in this case, the width is very large (Γ = 320 MeV), implying a very short lifetime, so the decay length would indeed be minuscule. For example, a width of 100 MeV corresponds to a lifetime of around 6.6e-24 seconds, leading to a decay length of a few femtometers if the particle is moving at relativistic speeds.

Wait, earlier I had 2.056e-24 s. Wait, no, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056e-25 s. Wait, I think I made a mistake here earlier. Let me correct that.\n\nΓ_X is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So L = 6.593 * 6.168e-17 ≈ 4.066e-16 m, which is 0.0004 femtometers. Wait, this is even smaller. Now I'm confused. There's a discrepancy here. Let me check the value of ħ in GeV·s. Yes, ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056e-25 s. Then, cτ = 3e8 * 2.056e-25 = 6.168e-17 m. Then, γβ = 6.593. So L = 6.593 * 6.168e-17 ≈ 4.066e-16 m. That's 4.066e-16 meters, which is 0.4066 femtometers. But this seems inconsistent with my previous calculation. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent. Let me redo the calculation.\n\nWait, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 = 20.56875 * 1e-25 = 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, no, 6.582 divided by 0.32 is 20.56875? Wait, 0.32 * 20 = 6.4, 0.32 * 20.56875 = 6.4 + 0.32*0.56875 ≈ 6.4 + 0.182 ≈ 6.582. So yes, 6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875. Therefore, τ = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s. So cτ = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ 6.1706e-16 m. Then, γβ = 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.593. So L = 6.593 * 6.1706e-16 ≈ 4.07e-15 m, which is 4.07 femtometers. So that's the same as before. So the correct value is approximately 4.07e-15 meters, or 4.07 femtometers. But this seems extremely small. However, given the very short lifetime (τ ≈ 2e-24 seconds), even with a high gamma factor, the decay length is minuscule. For example, a tau lepton with a lifetime of ~3e-13 seconds and gamma factor of, say, 1 would have a decay length of cτ ≈ 3e8 * 3e-13 = 9e-5 meters, or 0.09 millimeters. But here, the lifetime is 2e-24 seconds, which is 1e-11 times shorter, leading to a decay length of 4e-15 m, which is 4 femtometers. This is indeed correct, as particles with large widths (short lifetimes) decay almost immediately. Therefore, the mean decay distance is on the order of femtometers, which is much smaller than the size of a nucleus.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

The mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \) can be calculated using the formula:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} = \frac{8 \, \text{GeV}}{1.2 \, \text{GeV}} \approx 6.6667 \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \approx 0.9887 \) is the velocity as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( c \approx 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) is the speed of light,
- \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma_X} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s}}{0.32 \, \text{GeV}} \approx 2.056 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \) is the proper lifetime.

Calculating step by step:

First, γβ = 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.593.

Then, multiply by cτ: 6.593 * 3.0×10^8 m/s * 2.056×10^(-24) s.

Calculating the exponents: 3.0×10^8 * 2.056×10^(-24) = 6.168×10^(-16) m.

Now multiply by 6.593: 6.593 * 6.168×10^(-16) ≈ 4.066×10^(-15) m.

But this seems extremely small, which might indicate a mistake. Let me check the units and calculations again.

Wait, the proper lifetime τ is in seconds, and when multiplied by c (m/s), the unit becomes meters. So the calculation should be correct. However, 4.066×10^(-15) meters is on the order of femtometers, which is much smaller than typical decay lengths. This suggests an error in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Lorentz factor. Let me recalculate γ. The production energy E_X is given as 8 GeV, and the rest mass m_X is 1.2 GeV. So γ = E/m = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. That's correct.

But maybe the velocity calculation is wrong. Let me check β again. β = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)) when E is the total energy. Wait, actually, the total energy is E = γm, so γ = E/m. Then, β = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)) = sqrt(1 - (1.2^2)/(8^2)) = sqrt(1 - 1.44/64) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. That's correct.

So the velocity is about 0.9887c. Then, γβ = 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.593. Then, cτ = 3e8 m/s * 2.056e-24 s ≈ 6.168e-16 m. Then, L = 6.593 * 6.168e-16 ≈ 4.066e-15 m, which is 4.066 femtometers. That's indeed very small, but considering the particle's short lifetime due to the large width (Γ = 320 MeV), the lifetime τ is extremely short, leading to a tiny decay length. However, this seems inconsistent with typical particle decay lengths, which are often on the order of millimeters or centimeters for weakly decaying particles. But in this case, the width is very large (Γ = 320 MeV), implying a very short lifetime, so the decay length would indeed be minuscule. For example, a width of 100 MeV corresponds to a lifetime of around 6.6e-24 seconds, leading to a decay length of a few femtometers if the particle is moving at relativistic speeds. So perhaps the calculation is correct. Let me confirm with another approach.

Alternatively, using natural units where ħ = c = 1, the mean decay length L = (E_X / m_X) * (1/Γ_X) * cτ. Wait, but in natural units, c=1 and ħ=1, so τ = ħ/Γ_X, and L = βγcτ. But when converting to SI units, we need to include the appropriate factors. Let me try using natural units first and then convert.

In natural units (GeV and s), τ = ħ / Γ_X. But ħ in GeV·s is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056e-25 seconds. Wait, earlier I had 2.056e-24 s. Wait, no, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056e-25 s. Wait, I think I made a mistake here earlier. Let me correct that.

Γ_X is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ_X = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056e-25 seconds. Then, cτ = 3e8 m/s * 2.056e-25 s ≈ 6.168e-17 m. Then, γβ = 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.593. So L = 6.593 * 6.168e-17 ≈ 4.066e-16 m, which is 0.0004 femtometers. Wait, this is even smaller. Now I'm confused. There's a discrepancy here. Let me check the value of ħ in GeV·s. Yes, ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056e-25 s. Then, cτ = 3e8 * 2.056e-25 = 6.168e-17 m. Then, γβ = 6.593. So L = 6.593 * 6.168e-17 ≈ 4.066e-16 m. That's 4.066e-16 meters, which is 0.4066 femtometers. But this seems inconsistent with my previous calculation. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent. Let me redo the calculation.

Wait, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 = 20.56875 * 1e-25 = 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, no, 6.582 divided by 0.32 is 20.56875? Wait, 0.32 * 20 = 6.4, 0.32 * 20.56875 = 6.4 + 0.32*0.56875 ≈ 6.4 + 0.182 ≈ 6.582. So yes, 6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875. Therefore, τ = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s. So cτ = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ 6.1706e-16 m. Then, γβ = 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.593. So L = 6.593 * 6.1706e-16 ≈ 4.07e-15 m, which is 4.07 femtometers. So that's the same as before. So the correct value is approximately 4.07e-15 meters, or 4.07 femtometers. But this seems extremely small. However, given the very short lifetime (τ ≈ 2e-24 seconds), even with a high gamma factor, the decay length is minuscule. For example, a tau lepton with a lifetime of ~3e-13 seconds and gamma factor of, say, 1 would have a decay length of cτ ≈ 3e8 * 3e-13 = 9e-5 meters, or 0.09 millimeters. But here, the lifetime is 2e-24 seconds, which is 1e-11 times shorter, leading to a decay length of 4e-15 m, which is 4 femtometers. This is indeed correct, as particles with large widths (short lifetimes) decay almost immediately. Therefore, the mean decay distance is on the order of femtometers, which is much smaller than the size of a nucleus. Therefore, the calculation seems correct.

But that seems extremely small. Is that correct?\n\nWait, 4e-15 meters is 4 femtometers. But particles with lifetimes of 1e-24 seconds would decay almost immediately. But let\'s check the calculation again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion. Let me re-examine the steps.\n\nFirst, Γ_X is given as 320 MeV. To compute the lifetime τ, we use τ = ħ / Γ_X. But in natural units (GeV and seconds), ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So, Γ_X in GeV is 0.32 GeV. Therefore, τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.0569e-24 seconds. That\'s correct.\n\nThen, γ = E/m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV ≈ 6.6667. Correct.\n\nβ = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)) = sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. Correct.\n\nSo, γβ = 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.5913. Correct.\n\nThen, cτ = 3e8 m/s * 2.0569e-24 s ≈ 6.1707e-16 m. Correct.\n\nThen, L = γβ * cτ ≈ 6.5913 * 6.1707e-16 ≈ 4.067e-15 m. Which is 4.067 femtometers. That\'s indeed a very short distance, but considering the lifetime is 2e-24 seconds, even moving at near the speed of light, the distance would be tiny. For example, c*tau is 3e8 m/s * 2e-24 s = 6e-16 m, which is 0.6 femtometers. Then multiplied by gamma beta ~6.6, gives ~4 femtometers. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, in particle physics, mean decay lengths are often on the order of millimeters or centimeters for weakly decaying particles. For example, a B meson has a cτ of about 450 microns. But here, the particle has a very large width (Γ = 320 MeV), which implies a very short lifetime. So, a large width corresponds to a short lifetime, hence a short decay length. So, 4 femtometers is indeed extremely short, which makes sense for a resonance that decays almost immediately.\n\nBut let me check if I messed up the units. Let\'s redo the calculation step by step.\n\nΓ_X = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.\n\nτ = ħ / Γ_X = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 s ≈ 2.0569e-24 s.\n\nγ = E/m = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.\n\nβ = sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2) = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) ≈ 0.9887.\n\ncτ = 3e8 m/s * 2.0569e-24 s ≈ 6.1707e-16 m.\n\nL = γβcτ ≈ 6.6667 * 0.9887 * 6.1707e-16 m ≈ 6.5913 * 6.1707e-16 ≈ 4.067e-15 m.\n\nYes, that\'s correct. So, 4.067e-15 meters is 4.067 femtometers. That\'s about the size of a nucleus, so the particle decays almost immediately after production, which is consistent with a resonance with a large width (Γ_X = 320 MeV). Resonances with large widths (short lifetimes) decay quickly, so their mean decay distances are minuscule.\n\nTherefore, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.07 femtometers. But let me check if there\'s another approach.\n\nAlternatively, in particle physics, sometimes the formula for the mean path length is written as L = (c * τ) * βγ. Since cτ is the distance light travels in the particle\'s lifetime, and βγ is the relativistic factor. So, yes, that\'s exactly what we calculated.\n\nAlternatively, using natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, but then converting to standard units. Let\'s see:\n\nIn natural units (GeV and inverse GeV), Γ_X is 0.32 GeV^{-1}, so τ = 1/Γ_X = 3.125 GeV^{-1}. Then, converting GeV^{-1} to seconds: 1 GeV^{-1} ≈ 6.582e-25 seconds. So τ = 3.125 * 6.582e-25 s ≈ 2.056e-24 s, same as before.\n\nThen, βγ = (E/m) * sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2) = (8/1.2) * sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) ≈ 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.5913.\n\nThen, L = βγ * cτ ≈ 6.5913 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056e-24 s ≈ same as before, 4.067e-15 m.\n\nSo, yes, same result. Therefore, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.07 femtometers.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects the answer in meters, or centimeters, or something else? Let me check the units again.\n\n4.07e-15 meters is 4.07 femtometers. In particle physics, sometimes decay lengths are given in centimeters. 1 femtometer is 1e-15 meters, which is 1e-13 centimeters. So, 4.07e-15 meters is 4.07e-13 centimeters. That\'s 0.000407 femtometers, but wait, no. Wait, 1 meter is 100 centimeters, so 1 femtometer is 1e-15 meters = 1e-13 centimeters. Therefore, 4.07e-15 meters = 4.07e-13 centimeters. So, 0.000407 picometers, or 407 attometers. Either way, it\'s a very small distance.\n\nBut given that the particle is a resonance, which typically decays via the strong interaction, which has a timescale of around 1e-23 seconds, which would correspond to a decay length of c*tau ~ 3e8 m/s * 1e-23 s = 3e-15 m, which is 3 femtometers, which is similar to our calculation here. So, 4 femtometers is reasonable for a strong decay.\n\nTherefore, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.07 femtometers, which can be written as 4.07 x 10^-15 meters.\n\nBut let me check once more for possible miscalculations. Let\'s recalculate the product γβcτ.\n\nγ = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666...\n\nβ = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.15^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887\n\nγβ ≈ 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.5913\n\ncτ = 3e8 m/s * 2.0569e-24 s ≈ 6.1707e-16 m\n\nMultiply 6.5913 * 6.1707e-16 m:\n\n6 * 6.1707e-16 = 3.7024e-15\n\n0.5913 * 6.1707e-16 ≈ 0.5913 * 6.1707 = approx 3.648, then 3.648e-16\n\nAdding 3.7024e-15 + 3.648e-16 = 4.0672e-15 m. Yes, that\'s correct.\n\nSo, 4.0672e-15 meters, which is 4.0672 femtometers. Rounded to two decimal places, 4.07 femtometers. But maybe the answer should be expressed in more precise terms with the given data.\n\nAlternatively, using more precise values for constants. Let\'s use ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm. Then, since τ = ħ / Γ, and L = γβcτ, so L = γβ * (ħc) / (Γ) * (1/m_X) ? Wait, no. Let me think.\n\nWait, τ = ħ / Γ, so cτ = ħc / Γ. Then, L = γβ * cτ = γβ * (ħc / Γ). Since ħc is 197.33 MeV·fm, and Γ is 320 MeV. So, L = γβ * (197.33 MeV·fm / 320 MeV) = γβ * (197.33 / 320) fm.\n\nCalculating 197.33 / 320 ≈ 0.6167 fm. Then, γβ ≈ 6.5913. So, L ≈ 6.5913 * 0.6167 fm ≈ 4.066 fm. So, same result. Therefore, 4.07 femtometers. This method is more straightforward.\n\nYes, using ħc = 197.33 MeV·fm, then L = γβ * (ħc) / Γ. Since Γ is in MeV, and ħc is in MeV·fm, the units work out to fm. Therefore, L = (γβ) * (197.33 / 320) fm ≈ 6.5913 * 0.6167 ≈ 4.066 fm. So, 4.07 fm.\n\nThis is a more efficient calculation. Therefore, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.07 femtometers. So, the answer is about 4.1 femtometers. Given the inputs, maybe we should keep two significant figures. The width is given as 320 MeV (two significant figures), the mass 1.2 GeV (two), and energy 8 GeV (one). But the energy is 8 GeV, which is one significant figure, but maybe it\'s an exact value. Depending on conventions, but perhaps the answer should be given as ~4 femtometers. However, since 320 is two sig figs, and 1.2 is two, and 8 is one, the least is one, but maybe the problem expects two. Alternatively, since 8 GeV could be considered as having one significant figure, but in particle physics, sometimes energy is known more precisely. But given the problem statement, it\'s safest to go with two significant figures. So, 4.1 femtometers, which is 4.1e-15 meters.\n\nBut let me check once more with the exact calculation:\n\nγβ = (8 / 1.2) * sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) = (20/3) * sqrt(1 - (9/400)) = (20/3) * sqrt(391/400) = (20/3) * (sqrt(391)/20) = sqrt(391)/3 ≈ 19.7746/3 ≈ 6.5915\n\nThen, 197.33 / 320 ≈ 0.61665625\n\nMultiply: 6.5915 * 0.61665625 ≈ 4.0665 femtometers. So, approximately 4.07 fm.\n\nTherefore, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.07 femtometers. So, the answer is 4.1 femtometers when rounded to two significant figures.\n\nBut let me check if the question expects the answer in meters or another unit. The problem says "mean decay distance," which is typically in meters or centimeters. But given the scale, femtometers are appropriate. However, in experimental contexts, sometimes they use centimeters. Let\'s convert 4.07e-15 meters to centimeters: 4.07e-15 m = 4.07e-13 cm. That\'s 0.407 femtometers in centimeters? Wait, no. 1 meter is 100 cm, so 1 femtometer is 1e-15 m = 1e-13 cm. Therefore, 4.07e-15 m = 4.07e-13 cm. But that\'s still a very small number. So, perhaps femtometers is the appropriate unit here.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might expect the answer expressed in natural units with appropriate unit conversions. But given the problem statement, it\'s safer to present the answer in meters with scientific notation.\n\nSo, 4.07e-15 meters. But let me check once more.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula L = (E * ħc) / (m * Γ) * sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2 )\n\nLet me see:\n\nL = (E / m) * sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2 ) * (ħc) / Γ\n\n= (E / m) * sqrt(1 - (m²/E²)) * (ħc) / Γ\n\n= (E / m) * sqrt( (E² - m²)/E² ) * (ħc)/Γ\n\n= (E / m) * (sqrt(E² - m²)/E ) * (ħc)/Γ\n\n= (sqrt(E² - m²)/m ) * (ħc)/Γ\n\n= (sqrt( (8)^2 - (1.2)^2 ) / 1.2 ) * (197.33 MeV fm) / (320 MeV )\n\nCompute sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV\n\nSo, 7.91 / 1.2 ≈ 6.5917\n\nThen, 197.33 / 320 ≈ 0.6167\n\nMultiply: 6.5917 * 0.6167 ≈ 4.066 fm. Same result.\n\nTherefore, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.07 femtometers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe mean decay distance is \\boxed{4.1 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ m}}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745447161, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4062, prompt_tokens=980, total_tokens=5042, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To calculate the mean decay distance for the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula \( L = \gamma \beta c \tau \), where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( \beta \) is the velocity in terms of the speed of light \( c \), and \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

1. **Calculate the proper lifetime \( \tau \):**
   \[
   \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma_X}
   \]
   Given \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \):
   \[
   \tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s}}{0.32 \, \text{GeV}} \approx 2.0569 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
   \]

2. **Calculate the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \):**
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} = \frac{8 \, \text{GeV}}{1.2 \, \text{GeV}} \approx 6.6667
   \]

3. **Calculate the velocity factor \( \beta \):**
   \[
   \beta = \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{m_X}{E_X} \right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1.2}{8} \right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} \approx 0.9887
   \]

4. **Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \):**
   \[
   L = \gamma \beta c \tau
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   L \approx 6.6667 \times 0.9887 \times 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \times 2.0569 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
   \]
   Simplifying step-by-step:
   \[
   \gamma \beta \approx 6.5913
   \]
   \[
   c \tau \approx 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \times 2.0569 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \approx 6.1707 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}
   \]
   \[
   L \approx 6.5913 \times 6.1707 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m} \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
   \]

Thus, the mean decay distance is \(\boxed{4.1 \times 10^{-15} \text{ m}}\).

τ ≈ 2.0569e-24 s

So, L ≈ 6.6667 * 0.9887 * 3.0e8 m/s * 2.0569e-24 s

First, multiply 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.6 (approx). Let me compute more accurately:

6.6667 * 0.9887:

6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322

0.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 0.6667*0.9887 ≈ 0.6591

Total ≈ 5.9322 + 0.6591 ≈ 6.5913

So, γβ ≈ 6.5913

Then, multiply by cτ: 3.0e8 m/s * 2.0569e-24 s = 3.0e8 * 2.0569e-24 = 6.1707e-16 m

Therefore, L ≈ 6.5913 * 6.1707e-16 m ≈ ?

Calculating 6.5913 * 6.1707e-16:

First, 6 * 6.1707e-16 = 3.7024e-15

0.5913 * 6.1707e-16 ≈ 3.648e-16

Total ≈ 3.7024e-15 + 3.648e-16 ≈ 4.0672e-15 meters

Wait, that's 4.0672e-15 meters. But that seems extremely small. Is that correct?

Wait, 4e-15 meters is 4 femtometers. But particles with lifetimes of 1e-24 seconds would decay almost immediately. But let's check the calculation again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion. Let me re-examine the steps.

First, Γ_X is given as 320 MeV. To compute the lifetime τ, we use τ = ħ / Γ_X. But in natural units (GeV and seconds), ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So, Γ_X in GeV is 0.32 GeV. Therefore, τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.0569e-24 seconds. That's correct.

Then, γ = E/m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV ≈ 6.6667. Correct.

β = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)) = sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. Correct.

So, γβ = 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.5913. Correct.

Then, cτ = 3e8 m/s * 2.0569e-24 s ≈ 6.1707e-16 m. Correct.

Then, L = γβ * cτ ≈ 6.5913 * 6.1707e-16 ≈ 4.067e-15 m. Which is 4.067 femtometers. That's indeed a very short distance, but considering the lifetime is 2e-24 seconds, even moving at near the speed of light, the distance would be tiny. For example, c*tau is 3e8 m/s * 2e-24 s = 6e-16 m, which is 0.6 femtometers. Then multiplied by gamma beta ~6.6, gives ~4 femtometers. So, yes, that seems correct.

But wait, in particle physics, mean decay lengths are often on the order of millimeters or centimeters for weakly decaying particles. For example, a B meson has a cτ of about 450 microns. But here, the particle has a very large width (Γ = 320 MeV), which implies a very short lifetime. So, a large width corresponds to a short lifetime, hence a short decay length. So, 4 femtometers is indeed extremely short, which makes sense for a resonance that decays almost immediately.

But let me check if I messed up the units. Let's redo the calculation step by step.

Γ_X = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

τ = ħ / Γ_X = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 s ≈ 2.0569e-24 s.

γ = E/m = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

β = sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2) = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) ≈ 0.9887.

cτ = 3e8 m/s * 2.0569e-24 s ≈ 6.1707e-16 m.

L = γβcτ ≈ 6.6667 * 0.9887 * 6.1707e-16 m ≈ 6.5913 * 6.1707e-16 ≈ 4.067e-15 m.

Yes, that's correct. So, 4.067e-15 meters is 4.067 femtometers. That's about the size of a nucleus, so the particle decays almost immediately after production, which is consistent with a resonance with a large width (Γ_X = 320 MeV). Resonances with large widths (short lifetimes) decay quickly, so their mean decay distances are minuscule.

Therefore, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.07 femtometers. But let me check if there's another approach.

Alternatively, in particle physics, sometimes the formula for the mean path length is written as L = (c * τ) * βγ. Since cτ is the distance light travels in the particle's lifetime, and βγ is the relativistic factor. So, yes, that's exactly what we calculated.

Alternatively, using natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, but then converting to standard units. Let's see:

In natural units (GeV and inverse GeV), Γ_X is 0.32 GeV^{-1}, so τ = 1/Γ_X = 3.125 GeV^{-1}. Then, converting GeV^{-1} to seconds: 1 GeV^{-1} ≈ 6.582e-25 seconds. So τ = 3.125 * 6.582e-25 s ≈ 2.056e-24 s, same as before.

Then, βγ = (E/m) * sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2) = (8/1.2) * sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) ≈ 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.5913.

Then, L = βγ * cτ ≈ 6.5913 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056e-24 s ≈ same as before, 4.067e-15 m.

So, yes, same result. Therefore, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.07 femtometers.

But perhaps the problem expects the answer in meters, or centimeters, or something else? Let me check the units again.

4.07e-15 meters is 4.07 femtometers. In particle physics, sometimes decay lengths are given in centimeters. 1 femtometer is 1e-15 meters, which is 1e-13 centimeters. So, 4.07e-15 meters is 4.07e-13 centimeters. That's 0.000407 femtometers, but wait, no. Wait, 1 meter is 100 centimeters, so 1 femtometer is 1e-15 meters = 1e-13 centimeters. Therefore, 4.07e-15 meters = 4.07e-13 centimeters. So, 0.000407 picometers, or 407 attometers. Either way, it's a very small distance.

But given that the particle is a resonance, which typically decays via the strong interaction, which has a timescale of around 1e-23 seconds, which would correspond to a decay length of c*tau ~ 3e8 m/s * 1e-23 s = 3e-15 m, which is 3 femtometers, which is similar to our calculation here. So, 4 femtometers is reasonable for a strong decay.

Therefore, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.07 femtometers, which can be written as 4.07 x 10^-15 meters.

But let me check once more for possible miscalculations. Let's recalculate the product γβcτ.

γ = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666...

β = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.15^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887

γβ ≈ 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.5913

cτ = 3e8 m/s * 2.0569e-24 s ≈ 6.1707e-16 m

Multiply 6.5913 * 6.1707e-16 m:

6 * 6.1707e-16 = 3.7024e-15

0.5913 * 6.1707e-16 ≈ 0.5913 * 6.1707 = approx 3.648, then 3.648e-16

Adding 3.7024e-15 + 3.648e-16 = 4.0672e-15 m. Yes, that's correct.

So, 4.0672e-15 meters, which is 4.0672 femtometers. Rounded to two decimal places, 4.07 femtometers. But maybe the answer should be expressed in more precise terms with the given data.

Alternatively, using more precise values for constants. Let's use ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm. Then, since τ = ħ / Γ, and L = γβcτ, so L = γβ * (ħc) / (Γ) * (1/m_X) ? Wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, τ = ħ / Γ, so cτ = ħc / Γ. Then, L = γβ * cτ = γβ * (ħc / Γ). Since ħc is 197.33 MeV·fm, and Γ is 320 MeV. So, L = γβ * (197.33 MeV·fm / 320 MeV) = γβ * (197.33 / 320) fm.

Calculating 197.33 / 320 ≈ 0.6167 fm. Then, γβ ≈ 6.5913. So, L ≈ 6.5913 * 0.6167 fm ≈ 4.066 fm. So, same result. Therefore, 4.07 femtometers. This method is more straightforward.

Yes, using ħc = 197.33 MeV·fm, then L = γβ * (ħc) / Γ. Since Γ is in MeV, and ħc is in MeV·fm, the units work out to fm. Therefore, L = (γβ) * (197.33 / 320) fm ≈ 6.5913 * 0.6167 ≈ 4.066 fm. So, 4.07 fm.

This is a more efficient calculation. Therefore, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.07 femtometers. So, the answer is about 4.1 femtometers. Given the inputs, maybe we should keep two significant figures. The width is given as 320 MeV (two significant figures), the mass 1.2 GeV (two), and energy 8 GeV (one). But the energy is 8 GeV, which is one significant figure, but maybe it's an exact value. Depending on conventions, but perhaps the answer should be given as ~4 femtometers. However, since 320 is two sig figs, and 1.2 is two, and 8 is one, the least is one, but maybe the problem expects two. Alternatively, since 8 GeV could be considered as having one significant figure, but in particle physics, sometimes energy is known more precisely. But given the problem statement, it's safest to go with two significant figures. So, 4.1 femtometers, which is 4.1e-15 meters.

But let me check once more with the exact calculation:

γβ = (8 / 1.2) * sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) = (20/3) * sqrt(1 - (9/400)) = (20/3) * sqrt(391/400) = (20/3) * (sqrt(391)/20) = sqrt(391)/3 ≈ 19.7746/3 ≈ 6.5915

Then, 197.33 / 320 ≈ 0.61665625

Multiply: 6.5915 * 0.61665625 ≈ 4.0665 femtometers. So, approximately 4.07 fm.

Therefore, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.07 femtometers. So, the answer is 4.1 femtometers when rounded to two significant figures.

But let me check if the question expects the answer in meters or another unit. The problem says "mean decay distance," which is typically in meters or centimeters. But given the scale, femtometers are appropriate. However, in experimental contexts, sometimes they use centimeters. Let's convert 4.07e-15 meters to centimeters: 4.07e-15 m = 4.07e-13 cm. That's 0.407 femtometers in centimeters? Wait, no. 1 meter is 100 cm, so 1 femtometer is 1e-15 m = 1e-13 cm. Therefore, 4.07e-15 m = 4.07e-13 cm. But that's still a very small number. So, perhaps femtometers is the appropriate unit here.

Alternatively, the problem might expect the answer expressed in natural units with appropriate unit conversions. But given the problem statement, it's safer to present the answer in meters with scientific notation.

So, 4.07e-15 meters. But let me check once more.

Alternatively, using the formula L = (E * ħc) / (m * Γ) * sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2 )

Let me see:

L = (E / m) * sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2 ) * (ħc) / Γ

= (E / m) * sqrt(1 - (m²/E²)) * (ħc) / Γ

= (E / m) * sqrt( (E² - m²)/E² ) * (ħc)/Γ

= (E / m) * (sqrt(E² - m²)/E ) * (ħc)/Γ

= (sqrt(E² - m²)/m ) * (ħc)/Γ

= (sqrt( (8)^2 - (1.2)^2 ) / 1.2 ) * (197.33 MeV fm) / (320 MeV )

Compute sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV

So, 7.91 / 1.2 ≈ 6.5917

Then, 197.33 / 320 ≈ 0.6167

Multiply: 6.5917 * 0.6167 ≈ 4.066 fm. Same result.

Therefore, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.07 femtometers.

**Final Answer**
The mean decay distance is \boxed{4.1 \times 10^{-15} \text{ m}}.
