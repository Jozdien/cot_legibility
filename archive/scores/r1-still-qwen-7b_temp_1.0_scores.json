Oxidation with PCC restores the aldehyde group without changing the carbon count.

We need to find the expectation value of the operator \\(10\\sigma_z + 5\\sigma_x\\).\n\nFirst, we calculate the expectation value of \\(\\sigma_z\\):\n\n1. The state can be written as \\(| \\psi \\rangle = 0.5 |\\uparrow\\rangle + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} |\\downarrow\\rangle\\).\n2. The Pauli matrix \\(\\sigma_z\\) is diagonal with eigenvalues 1 and -1 for \\(|\\uparrow\\rangle\\) and \\(|\\downarrow\\rangle\\), respectively.\n3.

As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function \u2013 G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control\u2019s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control\u2019s resistance; 0% \u2012 all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?",

      "r1-still-qwen-7b": "The experiment investigates the roles of three genes, G1, G2, and G3, in anthracnose resistance in white lupine. The knock-out mutants (g1, g2, g3) and double-mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3) are tested, with resistance levels measured against a control (100% resistance). The results are as follows:\n\n- **Single mutants:**\n  - **g1:** 75% resistance (a 25% reduction from control)\n  - **g2:** 0% resistance (complete loss of resistance)\n  - **g3:** 50% resistance (a 50% reduction from control)\n\n- **Double mutants:**\n  - **g1g2:** 0% resistance\n  - **g1g3:** 10% resistance (a 90% reduction from control)\n  - **g2g3:** 0% resistance\n\nFrom these results, several conclusions can be drawn:\n\n1. **G2 is a transcription factor critical for regulating other genes:**\n   - The complete loss of resistance in both single and double mutants (g2, g1g2, g2g3) suggests that G2 is essential and acts as a transcription factor upstream of other genes. Its knockout eliminates the expression of downstream genes, leading to loss of anthracnose resistance.\n\n2. **G1 has partial importance despite being non-essential:**\n   - The single mutant g1 shows 75% resistance, indicating that G1 contributes to resistance but is not absolutely essential. Its role may be redundant or have a secondary function in addition to G3.\n\n3. **G3 is more critical than G1 but non-essential:**\n   - The single mutant g3 shows 50% resistance, indicating it plays a more significant role in resistance than G1. However, both G1 and G3 can compensate for the loss of G2, which explains why their combined knockout (g1g3) results in only 10% resistance.\n\n4. **Interdependence of G1 and G2:**\n   - The double mutant g1g2 (0%) suggests that G1 is regulated by G2. Without G2, G1 cannot produce its necessary products, supporting the idea that G2 is a transcriptional regulator for G1.\n\nIn summary, G2 is identified as a transcription factor that is essential for regulating the expression of other resistance-related genes. Both G1 and G3 contribute to resistance, with G3 being more critical. The interdependence of these genes highlights the complexity of the resistance pathway, where each gene may have unique roles that are either additive or redundant depending on the presence of others. Additionally, G2's absence disrupts the activation of downstream genes, leading to complete loss of resistance phenotype.\n\n**Conclusion:** G2 is a critical transcription factor that regulates the expression of G1 and G3, and its knockout results in a total loss of resistance, indicating its essential role in the fungal disease response. G1 and G3 contribute partially to resistance but are supported by G2's regulation, which explains the mixed results observed in their single mutants."
