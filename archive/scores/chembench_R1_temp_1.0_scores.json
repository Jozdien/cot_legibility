      "R1": "The given SMILES `C1(=C(C)C=CC(C)=C1)` corresponds to **m-xylene** (1,3-dimethylbenzene), a benzene ring with two methyl groups in the meta positions. Here\u2019s the analysis for the number of peaks in its \u00b9H NMR spectrum:\n\n### Step 1: Structure Determination\nThe SMILES describes a six-membered aromatic ring (benzene) with methyl groups at positions 1 and 3. The molecule has **symmetry** (a plane passing through the two methyl groups and opposite carbon), leading to equivalent proton environments.\n\n### Step 2: Proton Environments\n1. **Methyl Protons**: Both methyl groups are in equivalent positions due to symmetry, resulting in **one peak**.\n2. **Aromatic Protons**:\n   - **Protons adjacent to methyl groups (ortho)**: Positions 2 and 6 (relative to each methyl group) experience deshielding from electron-withdrawing methyl groups. These protons are equivalent due to symmetry and appear as **one peak**.\n   - **Protons meta to methyl groups**: Positions 4 and 5 (exchanging via symmetry) are in equivalent environments, producing **one peak**.\n   - **Proton para to methyl groups**: The lone proton at position 5 (not adjacent to any methyl group) has a unique environment, forming **a fourth peak**. \n\nHowever, due to aromatic ring dynamics, rapid **ring flipping** (typical in benzene derivatives) averages the environments of some protons. After accounting for symmetry and dynamic effects:\n- Methyl protons (**1 peak**).\n- Ortho aromatic protons (**1 peak**).\n- Meta/para aromatic protons (**1 peak**).\n  \nThis simplification aligns with observed NMR spectra for m-xylene, where only **three peaks** are resolved\u00b9.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe number of peaks in the \u00b9H NMR spectrum of this molecule is **\\boxed{3}**."

      "R1": "**Step-by-Step Analysis and Answer:**\n\n1. **Parsing the SMILES:**\n   The given SMILES is `CC1OC2(CC2)C11CC1`. Breaking it down:\n   - **CC1**: Methyl group (CH\u2083) attached to carbon C1.\n   - **OC2(CC2)**: Oxygen (O) connected to C1, followed by a cyclopropane ring formed by C2 and the branch `(CC2)`. This creates a strained epoxide (oxygen in a 3-membered ring).\n   - **C11CC1**: Indicates two bridge closures (ring closure \"1\"), forming a bicyclic structure where C1 is part of both bridges.\n\n   The molecule is a **methyl-substituted bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane oxide** (norbornane oxide derivative), where the methyl group and oxide oxygen are attached to bridgehead carbons.\n\n2. **Identifying Proton Environments:**\n   - **Methyl Group (CH\u2083)**: Attached to a bridged carbon (C1), which is quaternary and lacks adjacent hydrogens. The CH\u2083 protons are equivalent and appear as **1 peak**.\n   - **Epoxide Protons (H-C-O)**: The two hydrogens on the cyclopropane ring (C2) adjacent to oxygen are in a symmetrical environment due to the rigid ring structure. They are equivalent, forming **1 peak**.\n   - **Bridgehead Protons (C7 and C4)**: Protons on the two bridgehead carbons (opposite the methyl and oxygen) are equivalent due to molecular symmetry, forming **1 peak**.\n   - **Bridge Protons (C5 and C6)**: The two hydrogens on the secondary bridge carbons are equivalent, forming **1 peak**.\n   - **Axial and Equatorial Protons**: In bicyclic frameworks, axial and equatorial positions might differ. However, symmetry renders all protons in equivalent positions for each category above.\n\n3. **Final Count:**\n   - Total **4 unique proton environments** result in **4 distinct peaks** in the \u00b9H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of peaks in the \u00b9H NMR spectrum of this molecule is **4**."

      "R1": "To determine the number of peaks in the \\( ^1\\text{H} \\) NMR spectrum of the molecule with SMILES CCC1OCC=C1, we first need to interpret the structure based on the SMILES notation. The molecule consists of a propane chain (CH3-CH2-CH2-) attached to a five-membered ring containing an oxygen atom and a double bond. The ring structure is a cyclopentene derivative with one oxygen atom, making it similar to a dihydrofuran.\n\n### Key steps in determining the number of NMR peaks:\n1. **Propane Chain**:\n   - **C1 (CH3 group)**: The three hydrogens on the terminal methyl group are equivalent, resulting in **1 peak**.\n   - **C2 (CH2 group)**: The two hydrogens on this carbon are adjacent to a chiral center (C3), making them non-equivalent. This results in **2 peaks**.\n   - **C3 (CH group)**: This carbon is part of the ring and has a unique environment due to bonding with the propane chain, oxygen, and the ring structure. This results in **1 peak**.\n\n2. **Ring Structure**:\n   - **C4 (CH2 group)**: The two hydrogens on this carbon are in different environments due to the asymmetry of the ring and the presence of the oxygen atom. This results in **2 peaks**.\n   - **C5 (CH group)**: The hydrogen on this carbon is in a unique environment due to the double bond adjacent to it. This results in **1 peak**.\n   - **C6 (CH group)**: The hydrogen on this carbon is also in a unique environment due to the double bond and its position in the ring. This results in **1 peak**.\n\n### Summary of Peaks:\n- Propane chain: 1 (C1) + 2 (C2) + 1 (C3) = 4 peaks\n- Ring structure: 2 (C4) + 1 (C5) + 1 (C6) = 4 peaks\n\n**Total number of peaks**: 4 (propane) + 4 (ring) = **8 peaks**.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe number of peaks in the \\( ^1\\text{H} \\) NMR spectrum of the molecule is \\boxed{8}."

To determine the number of unique proton environments in its \u00b9H NMR spectrum, we analyze the symmetry and equivalence of protons:\n\n1. **Carbonyl Group Contribution**: The carbonyl carbon (C=O) has no attached hydrogens, so it does not contribute a peak.\n\n2. **Bridgehead Protons**: The bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4) are not equivalent due to the asymmetry introduced by the oxygen atom. Each bridgehead proton environment is unique, but in this particular bicyclic system, hydrogen environments may still be equivalent due to symmetry.

      "R1": "The molecule with SMILES `N#CCC1=NCC2CN12` contains a nitrile group attached to a bicyclic structure. Here's the breakdown of the proton environments and the number of peaks in its \u00b9H NMR spectrum:\n\n1. **Nitrile-Adjacent CH\u2082 Group**:  \n   The first carbon after the nitrile (C\u2261C-CH\u2082-) forms a CH\u2082 group. This group is deshielded by the electron-withdrawing nitrile group, giving a distinct peak.\n\n2. **CH\u2082 Group Before the Bicyclic System**:  \n   The second CH\u2082 (C-CH\u2082-C=) is adjacent to the bicyclic ring and experiences a different electronic environment compared to the nitrile-adjacent CH\u2082, resulting in a separate peak.\n\n3. **Bicyclic Ring Protons**:  \n   - The bicyclic structure (a bridgehead system) introduces three unique environments:  \n     - **Bridgehead CH\u2082**: One peak from the two equivalent bridgehead protons.  \n     - **C=N-Adjacent CH\u2082**: Protons near the imine group (C=N) are deshielded, producing another peak.  \n     - **Axial vs. Equatorial Protons**: Steric and electronic differences in the bicyclic system create a distinct peak for non-equivalent protons on the same carbon in the ring.\n\n4. **Additional CH Group**:  \n   One of the bridgehead carbons is a CH group (not CH\u2082), contributing a unique peak due to its position in the rigid bicyclic framework.\n\n**Total Peaks**: **5** distinct proton environments lead to **5 peaks** in the \u00b9H NMR spectrum."

      "R1": "To determine the number of peaks in the \\( ^1\\text{H} \\) NMR spectrum of the molecule with SMILES OCC12CC1(O)CC2O, we start by analyzing the structure based on the SMILES notation. \n\n1. **Parsing the SMILES**:\n   - The SMILES indicates a bicyclic structure with three hydroxyl groups (O atoms). The structure is parsed as follows:\n     - There is a hydroxyl group (O) attached to a carbon (C), which is part of a bicyclic framework.\n     - The bicyclic structure involves two ring closures (labeled 1 and 2).\n     - Additional hydroxyl groups are attached at different positions within the bicyclic framework.\n\n2. **Structural Analysis**:\n   - The molecule is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane derivative with three hydroxyl groups. This structure creates a rigid bicyclic system with distinct environments for each proton.\n\n3. **Equivalent Protons**:\n   - **Hydroxyl Protons (OH)**: The three hydroxyl groups are in different environments due to the rigidity and symmetry of the bicyclic framework. Each OH group will appear as a separate peak, leading to three peaks.\n   - **Other Protons**:\n     - The methylene (CH\u2082) groups adjacent to the hydroxyl groups and within the bicyclic framework contribute additional peaks. Due to the rigidity of the structure, these protons are in different environments:\n       - One peak from the methylene group adjacent to the first hydroxyl group.\n       - Two peaks from the methylene groups in different positions within the bicyclic framework.\n     - Additional peaks from bridgehead protons (if any exist and are in unique environments).\n\n4. **Symmetry Considerations**:\n   - The symmetry of the bicyclic framework reduces the number of unique proton environments. However, the presence of hydroxyl groups at different positions disrupts some symmetry, leading to distinct environments for the protons.\n\n5. **Counting the Peaks**:\n   - Three peaks from the hydroxyl groups.\n   - Two additional peaks from the methylene groups in different environments.\n   - Considering possible overlap or equivalence in symmetrical positions, the total number of peaks is determined to be five.\n\n**Final Answer**: The number of peaks in the \\( ^1\\text{H} \\) NMR spectrum is \\(\\boxed{5}\\)."

      "R1": "The molecule with SMILES `C1C2OC3=C(OC=N3)C12` is a bicyclic compound with an oxygen atom and a nitrile oxide group. Here's the breakdown of the structure and the number of unique proton environments:\n\n1. **Bicyclic Framework**: The core structure is a bicyclo[2.2.1] system. This creates two bridgehead carbons (C1 and C2) and a third bridge (C4) connected to C1 and C2. The oxygen atom is part of the bicyclic framework, attached to C2 and C3.\n\n2. **Double Bond and Substituent**: \n   - C3 is double-bonded to C4 (forming a non-conjugated double bond).\n   - C4 has a nitrile oxide substituent (O\u2013C\u2261N+), where the nitrogen is part of a ring closure back to C3.\n\n3. **Symmetry Considerations**: \n   - The two bridgehead protons (on C1 and C2) are **not equivalent** due to the unsymmetrical placement of the nitrile oxide group.\n   - The double-bonded proton (on C3) and protons near oxygen (if present) are in distinct environments.\n\n4. **Distinct Proton Environments**:\n   - **Bridgehead Protons**: C1 and C2 each have unique environments (2 peaks).\n   - **Double-Bond Proton**: The proton on C3 (attached to oxygen and the double bond) is distinct (1 peak).\n   - **Nitrile Oxide Adjacent Proton**: A unique proton near the nitrile oxide group (1 peak).\n   - **Possible Bridge Methine Protons**: Bridging carbons (C4) may contribute an additional peak (1 peak).\n\n**Total Number of Peaks**: 5 distinct peaks. \n\nHowever, adjusting for potential equivalences (e.g., lack of protons on nitrile oxide or symmetry in the bridge), the final count is **4 peaks**.\n\n**Answer**: The 1H NMR spectrum of the molecule has **4 distinct peaks**."

      "R1": "To determine the number of peaks in the \\( ^1 \\text{H NMR} \\) spectrum of the molecule with SMILES notation \\( \\text{ON=C1CC2CCC12O} \\), we need to analyze the structure and identify equivalent proton environments.

The other bridge also has protons influenced by the bicyclic structure\u2019s symmetry (or lack thereof).\n\n4. **Symmetry and Equivalence**:\n   - The substituents (\\( \\text{O-N=C} \\) and \\( \\text{-OH} \\)) break any potential symmetry in the bicyclic framework, leading to distinct environments for protons in the bridges.\n\n5. **Peak Count**:\n   - **Two Hydroxyl Protons**: Unique environments give two peaks.\n   - **Bridgehead Protons**: Two distinct peaks.\n   - **Bridge Protons**: Three distinct CH\\(_2\\) environments, one peak each.\n   - **Remaining Protons**: One peak from the other bridge's protons.\n\nSumming these, we account for **six distinct proton environments**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{6}"

      "R1": "The molecule with SMILES **OCC#CC1COCO1** can be broken down into the following structure: a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to a CH\u2082 group, followed by a propargyl group (C\u2261C), connected to a 1,3-dioxolane ring. The key steps to determine the number of peaks in its \u00b9H NMR spectrum are as follows:\n\n1. **Hydroxyl (-OH) Proton**:  \n   The -OH proton appears as a broad singlet due to hydrogen bonding and rapid exchange. This contributes **1 peak**.\n\n2. **CH\u2082 Adjacent to -OH (C2)**:  \n   This CH\u2082 group (O-CH\u2082-C\u2261C) has two equivalent protons. Since it is adjacent to an electronegative oxygen and no neighboring protons (the triple bond carbons have no protons), these protons resonate as a **singlet**, contributing **1 peak**.\n\n3. **Proton on the Ring-Connected CH (C5)**:  \n   The CH group (C5) connects the propargyl chain to the ring. Its single proton couples with the two equivalent protons on the adjacent CH\u2082 group (C6), resulting in a **triplet**. However, multiplicity does not increase the peak count, so this contributes **1 peak**.\n\n4. **CH\u2082 Groups in the 1,3-Dioxolane Ring (C6 and C8)**:  \n   - **C6 CH\u2082**: These two protons are adjacent to the CH group (C5) and exhibit coupling with its proton, forming a **doublet**.  \n   - **C8 CH\u2082**: These two protons are not adjacent to any protons (only oxygens), appearing as a **singlet**.  \n   Due to the asymmetry introduced by the propargyl substituent at C5, C6 and C8 are in distinct environments, leading to **2 separate peaks**.\n\n**Total Peaks**:  \n1 (OH) + 1 (C2 CH\u2082) + 1 (C5 CH) + 1 (C6 CH\u2082) + 1 (C8 CH\u2082) = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Answer**:  \nThe number of peaks in the \u00b9H NMR spectrum of this molecule is **5**."
