The eigenvalues of \\(\\sigma_z\\) for \\(|\\uparrow\\rangle\\) and \\(|\\downarrow\\rangle\\) are \\(+1\\) and \\(-1\\), respectively.

The Pauli matrix \\(\\sigma_x\\) swaps the states \\(|\\uparrow\\rangle\\) and \\(|\\downarrow\\rangle\\). The expectation value \\(\\langle \\sigma_x \\rangle\\) is computed as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\langle \\sigma_x \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | \\sigma_x | \\psi \\rangle\n\\]\n\nThe state \\(| \\psi \\rangle\\) is \\(0.5|\\uparrow\\rangle + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}|\\downarrow\\rangle\\).

These changes occur because the presence of isolated magnetic charges breaks the symmetry between electric and magnetic fields, introducing additional terms into the equations.\n\n1. **Gauss's Law for Magnetism**: Originally states that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero, implying no magnetic monopoles. With isolated magnetic charges, this law becomes \u2207\u00b7B = \u03bc\u2080\u03c1_m, where \u03c1_m is the magnetic charge density.\n\n2. **Faraday's Law**: Originally describes how a changing magnetic field induces an electric field. With magnetic monopoles, an additional term is introduced, making it \u2207\u00d7E = -\u2202B/\u2202t - \u03bc\u2080J_m, where J_m is the magnetic current density.\n\n3. **Amp\u00e8re's Law**: Originally relates the curl of the magnetic field to electric currents and displacement currents. In the presence of magnetic monopoles, an additional term for magnetic current is added, resulting in \u2207\u00d7B = \u03bc\u2080J_e + \u03bc\u2080\u03b5\u2080\u2202E/\u2202t + \u03bc\u2080J_m.\n\nThus, the three modified equations are:\n\n- Gauss's Law for Magnetism\n- Faraday's Law\n- Amp\u00e8re's Law\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{\\text{Gauss's Law for magnetism, Faraday's Law, and Amp\u00e8re's Law}}$"

    "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function \u2013 G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control\u2019s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control\u2019s resistance; 0% \u2012 all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?",

      "r1-still-qwen-7b": "The experiment investigates the interactions between three candidate genes, G1, G2, and G3, which may contribute to white lupine's resistance to the fungal pathogen Anthracnose. The researchers tested the effects of single and double knockouts on resistance levels. The results are as follows:\n\n- **Single mutants**:\n  - G1 knockout: 75% resistance\n  - G2 knockout: 0% resistance\n  - G3 knockout: 50% resistance\n\n- **Double mutants**:\n  - G1G2: 0% resistance\n  - G1G3: 10% resistance\n  - G2G3: 0% resistance\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **G2 Knockout Alone**: Resistance drops to 0%, indicating that G2 is an essential gene for resistance. Without G2, the plant cannot resist the pathogen, suggesting G2 is a critical transcription factor.\n\n2. **G1 Knockout Alone**: Resistance is reduced to 75%, indicating that G1 contributes positively to resistance but is not essential. Without G1, the plant's resistance is lower but not completely eliminated.\n\n3. **G3 Knockout Alone**: Resistance is reduced to 50%, suggesting that G3 has a role in resistance, but it is less critical than G2. Without G3, the plant's resistance is still present, though diminished.\n\n4. **Double Mutants**:\n   - **G1G2**: 0% resistance, indicating that without both G1 and G2, the plant cannot resist the pathogen. This suggests that G1 requires G2 for full function.\n   - **G1G3**: 10% resistance, showing that without both G1 and G3, the plant's resistance drops significantly, though not completely. This may indicate some residual function or partial redundancy between G1 and G3.\n   - **G2G3**: 0% resistance, indicating that without both G2 and G3, the plant cannot resist the pathogen. This suggests that G3 requires G2 for full function.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe data supports the following conclusions about the interactions between the genes:\n- **G2 is an essential transcription factor** that is required for the function of both G1 and G3. Without G2, neither G1 nor G3 can contribute to resistance, leading to 0% resistance in double mutants (G1G2 and G2G3).\n- **G1 and G3 have some degree of redundancy** but are not fully dependent on each other. When G2 is present, G1 can function to some extent (75% resistance alone), and G3 can function more actively (50% resistance alone). However, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out without G2, resistance drops to 10%, indicating a significant loss of function due to the absence of G2.\n- **G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3**, meaning that G1 and G3 are downstream effectors of G2. The partial resistance observed in single mutants of G1 and G3 suggests that they may have residual functions independent of G2, but their full function requires G2.\n\nThis hierarchical regulatory model highlights the importance of G2 in coordinating the transcriptional activity of G1 and G3, which are involved in the plant's defense mechanisms against Anthracnose.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe data indicates that G2 is an essential transcription factor required for the function of both G1 and G3. Without G2, neither G1 nor G3 can contribute to resistance, leading to complete susceptibility. G1 and G3 exhibit some degree of redundancy, allowing partial resistance when G2 is absent, but their full function requires G2. This hierarchical regulatory model suggests that G2 is upstream of G1 and G3, and their interactions are critical for the plant's defense mechanisms against the fungal pathogen."
