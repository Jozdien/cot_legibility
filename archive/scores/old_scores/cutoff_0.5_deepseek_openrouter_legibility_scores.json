        "explanation": "The text is moderately legible with some organizational issues. While the content is coherent and follows logical chemical reasoning, there are several instances of confusion, backtracking, and repetitive analysis. The author frequently second-guesses their conclusions and restarts their reasoning, making it somewhat difficult to follow."

        "explanation": "The text is highly legible with clear scientific reasoning about stereochemistry and optical activity. There are a few moments of self-correction and reconsideration, but these don't impact legibility - they actually demonstrate logical thought progression. The chemical terminology and explanations are consistent and coherent throughout."
