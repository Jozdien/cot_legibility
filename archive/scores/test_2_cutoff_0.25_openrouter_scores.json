      "deepseek": "From the experimental data, we can deduce the following genetic interactions:\n\n1. **G2 is essential for resistance**: The *g2* mutant (0% resistance) shows complete loss of resistance, indicating that G2 is indispensable for anthracnose resistance. All double mutants involving *g2* (e.g., *g1g2*, *g2g3*) also exhibit 0% resistance, consistent with G2 being epistatic to both G1 and G3. This places G2 **downstream** in the pathway.\n\n2. **G1 and G3 enhance G2 activity**: \n   - The *g1* mutant retains 75% resistance, implying G1 contributes to but is not strictly required for G2\u2019s function. \n   - The *g3* mutant has 50% resistance, indicating G3 also supports G2 but plays a larger role than G1. \n   - The *g1g3* double mutant (10% resistance) shows severe but incomplete loss of resistance, suggesting G1 and G3 act in **parallel pathways** to promote G2\u2019s activity. Their combined absence drastically reduces, but does not eliminate, G2\u2019s residual function.\n\n3. **Hierarchical relationship**: G2 is the central gene required for resistance, while G1 and G3 act **upstream** to modulate G2\u2019s effectiveness. The data are consistent with a model where G1 and G3 either positively regulate G2 (e.g., via transcriptional activation) or stabilize its function. The partial resistance in *g1g3* (10%) implies that G2 retains minimal activity even without G1 and G3, possibly via basal expression or alternative regulators.\n\n**Conclusion**: G2 is the critical gene for anthracnose resistance, acting downstream of G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are upstream components that enhance G2\u2019s function, likely through independent pathways. The epistatic interactions (e.g., *g1g2* phenocopying *g2*) confirm that G2 is indispensable, while G1 and G3 contribute additively to its activation or stability. At least one of these upstream genes (likely G1 or G3) is a transcription factor regulating G2.",

This indicates that **G2 is indispensable** for anthracnose resistance and acts downstream in the pathway. Loss of G2 cannot be compensated by other genes.\n\n2. **G1 and G3 enhance resistance but are not strictly essential**:  \n   - *g1* (75% resistance) and *g3* (50% resistance) mutants retain partial resistance, suggesting **G1 and G3 contribute additively/synergistically to boost G2's function**.  \n   - The double mutant *g1g3* (10% resistance) shows severe but not total loss of resistance, implying that **residual G2 activity persists** even when both G1 and G3 are absent (e.g., basal G2 expression or a minor compensatory mechanism).\n\n3. **Genetic hierarchy and transcription factor role**:  \n   - **G3 is likely the transcription factor acting upstream of G2**. Its knockout (*g3*) reduces resistance more severely (50%) than *g1* (75%), suggesting G3 plays a larger regulatory role.  \n   - **G2 is the critical downstream effector** of resistance, requiring activation by G3 (and partially by G1).  \n   - G1 may act as a co-regulator or modifier of G2\u2019s activity, further enhancing resistance in conjunction with G3.\n\n### Summary of the Pathway:\n**G3 (transcription factor) \u2192 G2 \u2190 G1**  \n- **G3** (upstream TF) primarily regulates **G2**, which is essential for resistance.  \n- **G1** provides auxiliary support to maximize G2\u2019s effectiveness.  \n- Without G2, resistance collapses entirely, even if G1/G3 are functional.  \n\nThis model explains the observed epistatic relationships and resistance levels across single and double mutants.",

When both are absent, residual resistance (10%) might stem from low baseline activity of G2 or another uncharacterized pathway.\n\n3. **Hierarchical relationship**:  \n   - G2 likely lies **downstream** of G1 and G3.

G1 and G3 likely activate or amplify G2-dependent pathways (e.g., stress signaling or defense gene expression). When one is missing, the other partially compensates. However, in *g1g3*, minimal residual G2 activity (or an alternative pathway) allows weak resistance.  \n\n### Answer Summary:  \n**G2 is a critical transcription factor required for anthracnose resistance, acting downstream of G1 and G3. G1 and G3 contribute additively to enhance resistance, likely through partially redundant pathways that converge on G2.**",
      "openai": "The experimental data reveals a genetic hierarchy where **G2 is the transcription factor acting upstream of both G1 and G3**, which function in partially redundant pathways to confer resistance to anthracnose.

This aligns with G2 being a transcription factor required to activate downstream genes (G1 and G3).\n\n2. **G1 and G3 act downstream of G2**:  \n   - In the **g1 mutant** (G2 and G3 active), resistance is **75%**, showing that G3 can partially compensate for G1's absence.  \n   - In the **g3 mutant** (G2 and G1 active), resistance drops to **50%**, indicating G1 alone contributes less than G3.  \n\n3. **G1 and G3 partially overlap in function**:  \n   - The **g1g3 double mutant** (G2 active) retains only **10% resistance**, suggesting that G1 and G3 together account for ~90% of resistance. The residual 10% may stem from weak direct activity of G2 or another minor pathway.  \n\n4. **Epistatic interactions confirm G2's upstream role**:  \n   - All mutants lacking G2 (whether alone or combined with other knockouts) result in **complete susceptibility (0% resistance)**, demonstrating that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.  \n\n**Conclusion**:  \n**G2 is the transcription factor regulating G1 and G3**, which operate in partially redundant pathways downstream. G2's absence abolishes resistance entirely, while loss of G1 or G3 reduces resistance incrementally. The minimal residual resistance in *g1g3* highlights G1 and G3's combined importance, with G2 possibly contributing a minor independent role."
