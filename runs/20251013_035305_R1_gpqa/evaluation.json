For rocky planets, greater mass leads to higher gravitational compression. Using the mass-radius relationship \\( R \\propto M^{1/3.7} \\), a 5 Earth-mass planet would have a radius ~1.54\u00d7 Earth's, resulting in a density of **~7.5 g/cm\u00b3** (higher due to compression).\n- **Option d**: Half Earth\u2019s mass with Earth-like composition.

As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function \u2013 G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control\u2019s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control\u2019s resistance; 0% \u2012 all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n",
      "answer": "Based on the experimental results, the following conclusions can be drawn regarding the genetic interactions:\n\n1. **G2 is the critical downstream gene required for resistance**:  \n   - The **g2** mutant (0% resistance) and all double mutants involving **g2** (g1g2, g2g3) also show 0% resistance. This indicates that **G2 is essential** for anthracnose resistance, as its loss completely abolishes resistance.  \n   - **Epistasis analysis** confirms that G2 acts downstream: the phenotypes of g1g2 and g2g3 match the g2 single mutant, showing that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.  \n\n2. **G1 and G3 regulate G2 in upstream pathways**:  \n   - Single mutants **g1** (75% resistance) and **g3** (50% resistance) retain partial resistance, suggesting that **G1 and G3 enhance G2 activity** but are not strictly required for its function.  \n   - The **g1g3 double mutant** (10% resistance) exhibits a synergistic reduction in resistance, implying that **G1 and G3 act in partially redundant pathways** to activate G2. Loss of both reduces G2 activity to minimal levels, but residual activity persists (10%), unlike when G2 itself is absent (0%).  \n\n3. **Hierarchical pathway structure**:  \n   - G1 and G3 likely function **upstream of G2**, converging to regulate its activity. G2 is the central effector whose product is indispensable for resistance.  \n   - The stronger phenotype of **g3 vs. g1** (~50% vs. 75% resistance) suggests **G3 plays a larger role** than G1 in activating G2.  \n\n4. **Possible transcription factor roles**:  \n   - The problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream. Given their upstream regulatory roles, **G1 or G3 may encode transcription factors** that activate G2 expression or modulate its activity.  \n\nIn summary, the resistance pathway operates hierarchically: **G1 and G3 act upstream to regulate G2**, which is the critical downstream gene required for anthracnose resistance. Loss of G2 abolishes resistance entirely, while partial loss of G1 or G3 reduces resistance but does not eliminate it. The synthetic lethality in the g1g3 double mutant highlights their redundant contributions to G2 activation.",

      "answer": "To distinguish two quantum states with energies \\( E_1 \\) and \\( E_2 \\) and lifetimes \\( 10^{-9} \\) seconds and \\( 10^{-8} \\) seconds respectively, we need to consider the uncertainty principle. The energy uncertainty for each state is given by \\( \\Delta E \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau} \\), where \\( \\hbar \\) is the reduced Planck constant and \\( \\tau \\) is the lifetime.\n\n1. Calculate the natural line width (energy uncertainty) for each state:\n   - For \\( E_1 \\) with lifetime \\( 10^{-9} \\) seconds:\n     \\[\n     \\Gamma_1 = \\frac{\\hbar}{10^{-9}} = \\frac{1.0545718 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J\u00b7s}}{10^{-9} \\, \\text{s}} = 1.0545718 \\times 10^{-25} \\, \\text{J}\n     \\]\n   - For \\( E_2 \\) with lifetime \\( 10^{-8} \\) seconds:\n     \\[\n     \\Gamma_2 = \\frac{\\hbar}{10^{-8}} = \\frac{1.0545718 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J\u00b7s}}{10^{-8} \\, \\text{s}} = 1.0545718 \\times 10^{-26} \\, \\text{J}\n     \\]\n\n2. Convert the energy uncertainties to electron volts (eV):\n   - Convert \\( \\Gamma_1 \\):\n     \\[\n     \\Gamma_1 = \\frac{1.0545718 \\times 10^{-25} \\, \\text{J}}{1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J/eV}} \\approx 0.659 \\, \\mu\\text{eV}\n     \\]\n   - Convert \\( \\Gamma_2 \\):\n     \\[\n     \\Gamma_2 = \\frac{1.0545718 \\times 10^{-26} \\, \\text{J}}{1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J/eV}} \\approx 0.0659 \\, \\mu\\text{eV}\n     \\]\n\n3. Sum the uncertainties to find the minimum resolvable energy difference:\n   \\[\n   \\Gamma_1 + \\Gamma_2 \\approx 0.659 \\, \\mu\\text{eV} + 0.0659 \\, \\mu\\text{eV} \\approx 0.725 \\, \\mu\\text{eV}\n   \\]\n\n4. Conclude that the energy difference should be greater than approximately \\( 0.725 \\, \\mu\\text{eV} \\). Given typical rounding in such problems, the closest higher value is \\( 10^{-6} \\, \\text{eV} \\) (1 \u03bceV).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{10^{-6} \\text{ eV}}\n\\]",
