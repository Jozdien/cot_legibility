The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA. ", "dataset": "gpqa", "answer": "I notice that the question refers to \"the following statements\" but doesn't actually include any statements for me to evaluate. For me to identify the incorrect statement about SARS-CoV-2 molecular biology, I would need to see the list of statements you're referring to.\n\nCould you please provide the complete set of statements that I should evaluate?", "reasoning": "I need to evaluate statements about the molecular biology of SARS-CoV-2 and identify the incorrect one. However, I don't see the statements in the question. The question says \"All the following statements... are correct except\" but then doesn't provide the statements I'm supposed to evaluate.\n\nSince no specific statements are provided, I should indicate that I need to see the statements before I can determine which one is incorrect. It's likely that the statements are missing from the question.", "model": "claude-3-7-sonnet-latest", "temperature": 1.0, "timestamp": "2025-10-13T17:41:02.981807Z", "metadata": {"duration_ms": 3690, "tokens": 259}}
