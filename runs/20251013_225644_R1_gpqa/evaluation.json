What are the elements of the normalized eigenvector? \n",
      "answer": "To find the eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator \\(\\vec{P}\\) for a muon along an arbitrary direction \\(\\vec{n}\\) lying in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue \\(+\\hbar/2\\), we start by expressing the operator \\(P_n\\) along the direction \\(\\vec{n}\\). The direction vector \\(\\vec{n}\\) in the x-z plane can be parametrized by an angle \\(\\theta\\) from the z-axis, giving components \\(n_x = \\sin\\theta\\) and \\(n_z = \\cos\\theta\\).\n\nThe operator \\(P_n\\) is given by:\n\\[\nP_n = \\sin\\theta \\cdot P_x + \\cos\\theta \\cdot P_z\n\\]\nwhere \\(P_x\\) and \\(P_z\\) are the Pauli matrices scaled by \\(\\hbar/2\\):\n\\[\nP_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting these into \\(P_n\\), we get:\n\\[\nP_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\sin\\theta \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\cos\\theta \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nWe need to solve the eigenvalue equation for the eigenvalue \\(+\\hbar/2\\). This simplifies to finding the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 1 for the matrix:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nSolving the eigenvalue equation:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThis leads to the system of equations:\n\\[\n\\cos\\theta \\cdot a + \\sin\\theta \\cdot b = a\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sin\\theta \\cdot a - \\cos\\theta \\cdot b = b\n\\]\n\nRearranging these equations, we find:\n\\[\n(1 - \\cos\\theta)a = \\sin\\theta \\cdot b\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sin\\theta \\cdot a = (1 + \\cos\\theta) \\cdot b\n\\]\n\nSolving these, we express \\(a\\) in terms of \\(b\\):\n\\[\na = \\cot\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\cdot b\n\\]\n\nNormalizing the eigenvector, we find \\(a = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\\) and \\(b = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\\). Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\\\ \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\end{pmatrix}}\n\\]",

      "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function \u2013 G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control\u2019s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control\u2019s resistance; 0% \u2012 all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n",

      "answer": "In a parallel universe where magnetic monopoles exist, Maxwell's equations would be modified to account for the presence of magnetic charge density (\\(\\rho_m\\)) and magnetic current density (\\(\\mathbf{J}_m\\)). The key changes occur in the equations that originally assume the absence of magnetic monopoles. Specifically:\n\n1. **Gauss's Law for Magnetism**: The original equation \\(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0\\) is modified to include the magnetic charge density. This becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0 \\rho_m\n   \\]\n   This reflects the existence of isolated magnetic charges.\n\n2. **Faraday's Law of Induction**: The original equation \\(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}\\) is modified to include the magnetic current density. This becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} - \\mu_0 \\mathbf{J}_m\n   \\]\n   This addition ensures the continuity equation for magnetic charge, analogous to how displacement current ensures charge conservation in Amp\u00e8re's Law.\n\nThe other Maxwell equations, Gauss's Law for electricity and Amp\u00e8re's Law with Maxwell's addition, remain unchanged in their forms as they pertain to electric charge and current densities.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe Maxwell equations that differ are Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law.
