      "answer": "# Analysis of Anthracnose Resistance in White Lupine Mutants\n\nBased on the resistance levels observed in the various mutants, I can draw several important conclusions about how these genes interact to confer fungal resistance.\n\n## Data Analysis\n\nFirst, let's analyze what each mutant reveals:\n\n- **g2 mutant (0% resistance)**: Loss of G2 completely eliminates resistance, suggesting G2 is essential\n- **g3 mutant (50% resistance)**: G3 contributes significantly to resistance\n- **g1 mutant (75% resistance)**: G1 has a smaller but meaningful contribution\n- **g1g3 double mutant (10% resistance)**: The combined loss is greater than expected from simply adding individual effects (would expect 25% resistance if additive)\n- **g2g3 and g1g2 double mutants (0% resistance)**: No resistance, as expected since g2 alone has 0% resistance\n\n## Gene Interaction Model\n\nBased on this pattern, the following relationship is most likely:\n\n**G2 functions as a transcription factor that regulates both G1 and G3**\n\nThe evidence supporting this conclusion:\n1. G2 is essential for any resistance (consistent with an upstream regulator)\n2. G1 and G3 appear to function downstream, with partial redundancy or synergy\n3. The g1g3 double mutant shows a synergistic effect (10% resistance instead of the expected 25% if effects were simply additive)\n\nWhen G2 (the transcription factor) is knocked out, neither G1 nor G3 can be properly activated, resulting in complete loss of resistance. G1 and G3 likely regulate overlapping sets of resistance genes, which explains why knocking out both results in much greater susceptibility than would be expected from their individual contributions.\n\nThe remaining 10% resistance in the g1g3 double mutant likely comes from minor G2-regulated pathways that operate independently of G1 and G3.",

Possibly, but the simpler explanation (Model D) seems sufficient to explain the data.\n\nBased on all this analysis, I believe the most likely conclusion is:\n\nG2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3.
