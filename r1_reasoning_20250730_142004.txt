Question: What is 2 + 2?

REASONING:
Okay, so I need to figure out what 2 + 2 is. Let me start by recalling basic addition. I know that addition combines two numbers into a larger number. Let's start with the number 2. If I have two objects and then add two more, how many do I have in total? Let me visualize it. Imagine two apples on the table. If someone gives me two more apples, I place them next to the existing ones. Now I count them all: one, two, three, four. So that's four apples. Therefore, 2 + 2 should equal 4. But wait, let me double-check to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Maybe using my fingers. Hold up two fingers on one hand and two on the other. When I put them together, that's four fingers. Yeah, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of it as incrementing 2 by 2. Starting at 2, adding 1 would be 3, and adding another 1 brings me to 4. So step by step, 2 + 1 = 3, then 3 + 1 = 4. Hence, adding two 1s to 2 results in 4. Is there another way to verify this? Maybe using a number line. If I start at 0 and move two units to the right, I land on 2. Then I move another two units to the right. Each unit is a step of 1, so two steps from 2 would be 3 and then 4. Yep, that lands on 4. All these methods consistently give me the same result. I think that confirms that 2 + 2 is indeed 4. I don't see any reason to doubt this unless there's some alternative math system, but in standard arithmetic, this should hold true.

FINAL ANSWER:
**Solution:**

To find the sum of 2 and 2, we can use basic addition principles.

1. **Visualizing Objects:**  
   Starting with 2 objects and adding 2 more results in a total of **4 objects**.

2. **Using Fingers:**  
   Holding up 2 fingers on each hand and combining them gives **4 fingers**.

3. **Incremental Addition:**  
   - \( 2 + 1 = 3 \)  
   - \( 3 + 1 = 4 \)  
   Thus, \( 2 + 2 = 4 \).

4. **Number Line:**  
   Starting at 0, moving 2 units right to 2, then another 2 units right lands at **4**.

**Final Answer:**  
\[
\boxed{4}
